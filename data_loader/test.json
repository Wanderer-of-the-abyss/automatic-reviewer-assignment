		"title": "Fixed versus mixed RSA: Explaining visual representations by fixed and mixed feature sets from shallow and deep computational models",
		"abstract": "Studies of the primate visual system have begun to test a wide range of complex computational object-vision models. Realistic models have many parameters, which in practice cannot be fitted using the limited amounts of brain-activity data typically available. Task performance optimization (e.g. using backpropagation to train neural networks) provides major constraints for fitting parameters and discovering nonlinear representational features appropriate for the task (e.g. object classification). Model representations can be compared to brain representations in terms of the representational dissimilarities they predict for an image set. This method, called representational similarity analysis (RSA), enables us to test the representational feature space as is (fixed RSA) or to fit a linear transformation that mixes the nonlinear model features so as to best explain a cortical areas representational space (mixed RSA). Like voxel/population-receptive-field modelling, mixed RSA uses a training set (different stimuli) to fit one weight per model feature and response channel (voxels here), so as to best predict the response profile across images for each response channel. We analysed response patterns elicited by natural images, which were measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that early visual areas were best accounted for by shallow models, such as a Gabor wavelet pyramid (GWP). The GWP model performed similarly with and without mixing, suggesting that the original features already approximated the representational space, obviating the need for mixing. However, a higher ventral-stream visual representation (lateral occipital region) was best explained by the higher layers of a deep convolutional network, and mixing of its feature set was essential for this model to explain the representation. We suspect that mixing was essential because the convolutional network had been trained to discriminate a set of 1000 categories, whose frequencies in the training set did not match their frequencies in natural experience or their behavioural importance. The latter factors might determine the representational prominence of semantic dimensions in higher-level ventral-stream areas. Our results demonstrate the benefits of testing both the specific representational hypothesis expressed by a models original feature space and the hypothesis space generated by linear transformations of that feature space.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWe tested computational models of representations in ventral-stream visual areas.\\nC_LIO_LIWe compared representational dissimilarities with/without linear remixing of model features.\\nC_LIO_LIEarly visual areas were best explained by shallow - and higher by deep - models.\\nC_LIO_LIUnsupervised shallow models performed better without linear remixing of their features.\\nC_LIO_LIA supervised deep convolutional net performed best with linear feature remixing.\\nC_LI",

Our results demonstrate the benefits of testing both the specific representational hypothesis expressed by a models original feature space and the hypothesis space generated by linear transformations of that feature space.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWe tested computational models of representations in ventral-stream visual areas.\\nC_LIO_LIWe compared representational dissimilarities with/without linear remixing of model features.\\nC_LIO_LIEarly visual areas were best explained by shallow - and higher by deep - models.\\nC_LIO_LIUnsupervised shallow models performed better without linear remixing of their features.\\nC_LIO_LIA supervised deep convolutional net performed best with linear feature remixing.\\nC_LI",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nTissue-clearing and three-dimensional (3D) imaging techniques aid clinical histopathological evaluation; however, further methodological developments are required prior to use in clinical practice.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe sought to develop a novel fluorescence staining method based on the classical PAS stain. We further attempted to develop a 3D imaging system based on this staining method and evaluated whether the system can be employed for quantitative 3D pathological evaluation and deep learning-based automatic diagnosis of inflammatory bowel diseases.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe successfully developed a novel periodic acid-FAM hydrazide (PAFhy) staining method for 3D imaging when combined with a tissue-clearing technique (PAFhy-3D). This strategy enabled clear and detailed imaging of the 3D architectures of crypts in human colorectal mucosa. PAFhy-3D imaging also revealed abnormal architectural changes in crypts in ulcerative colitis tissues and identified the distributions of neutrophils in cryptitis and crypt abscesses. PAFhy-3D revealed novel pathological findings including \"spiral staircase-like crypts\" specific to inflammatory bowel diseases. Quantitative analysis of crypts based on 3D morphological changes enabled differential diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and non-inflammatory bowel disease; such discrimination could not be achieved by pathologists. Furthermore, a deep learning-based system employing PAFhy-3D images was used to distinguish these diseases The accuracies were excellent (macro-average AUC = 0.94; F1 scores = 0.875 for ulcerative colitis, 0.717 for Crohn's disease, and 0.819 for non-inflammatory bowel disease).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPAFhy staining and PAFhy-3D imaging are promising approaches for next-generation experimental and clinical histopathology.",

		"abstract": "The holistic understanding of hydrochemical features is a crucial task for management and protection of water resources. However, it is challenging for a complex region, where multiple factors can cause hydrochemical changes in studied catchment. We collected 208 groundwater samples from such region in Kumamoto, southern Japan to explicitly characterize these processes by applying machine learning technique. The analyzed groundwater chemistry data like major cations and anions were fed to the self-organizing map (SOM) and the results were compared with classical classification approaches like Stiff diagram, standalone cluster analysis and score plots of principal component analysis (PCA). The SOM with integrated application of clustering divided the data into 11 clusters in this complex region. We confirmed that the results provide much greater details for the associated hydrochemical and contamination processes than the traditional approaches, which show quite good correspondence with the recent high resolution hydrological simulation model and aspects from geochemical modeling. However, the careful application of the SOM is necessary for obtaining accurate results. This study tested different normalization approaches for selecting the best SOM map and found that the topographic error (TE) was more important over the quantization error (QE). For instance, the lower QE obtained from min-max and log normalizations caused problems after clustering the SOM map, since the QE did not confirm the topological preservation. In contrast, the lowest TE obtained from Z-transformation data showed better spatial matching of the clusters with relevant hydrochemical characteristics. The results from this study clearly demonstrated that the SOM is a helpful approach for explicit understanding of the hydrochemical processes on reginal scale that may capably facilitate better groundwater resource management.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE\nThe motivation behind cancer subtyping is to identify subgroups of cancer patients with distinguishable phenotypes of clinical importance. It can assist in advancement of subtype-targeted based treatments. Subtype identification is a complicated task, therefore requires multi-omics data integration to identify the precise patients' subgroup. Over the years, several computational attempts have been made to identify the cancer subtypes accurately using integrative multi-omics analysis. Some studies have used Autoencoders (AE) to capture multi-omics feature integration in lower dimensions for identifying subtypes in specific types of cancer. However, capturing the highly informative latent space by learning the deep architectures of AE to attain a satisfactory generalized performance is required. Therefore, in this study, a novel AE-assisted cancer subtyping framework is presented that utilizes the compressed latent space of a Sparse AE neural network for multi-omics clustering.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe proposed framework first performs a supervised feature selection based on the survival status of the patients. The selected features from each of the omic data are passed to the AE. The information embedded in the latent space of the trained AE neural networks are then used for cancer subtyping using Spectral clustering. The AE architecture designed in this study exhaustively searches the best compression for multi-omics data by varying the number of neurons in the hidden layers and penalizing activations within the layers.\n\n\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSION\nThe proposed framework is applied to five different multi-omics cancer datasets taken from The Cancer Genome Atlas. It is observed that for getting a robust information bottleneck, a compression of 10-20% of the input features along with an L1 regularization penalty of 0.01 or 0.001 performs well for most of the cancer datasets. Clustering performed on this latent representation generates clusters with better silhouette scores and significantly varying survival patterns. For further biological assessment, differential expression analysis is performed between the identified subtypes of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), followed by enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed biomarkers. Several pathways and disease ontology terms coherent to GBM are found to be significantly associated. Varying responses of the identified GBM subtypes towards the drug Temozolomide is also tested to demonstrate its clinical importance. Hence, the study shows that AE-assisted multi-omics integration can be used for the prediction of clinically significant cancer subtypes.",

		"abstract": "Understanding computational principles in hierarchically organized sensory systems requires functional parcellation of brain structures and their precise targeting for manipulations. Although brain atlases are widely used to infer area locations in the mouse neocortex, it has been unclear whether stereotaxic coordinates based on standardized brain morphology accurately represent functional domains in individual animals. Here, we used intrinsic signal imaging to evaluate the accuracy of area delineation in the atlas by mapping functionally-identified auditory cortices onto bregma-based stereotaxic coordinates. We found that auditory cortices in the brain atlas correlated poorly with the true complexity of functional area boundaries. Inter-animal variability in functional area locations predicted surprisingly high error rates in stereotaxic targeting with atlas coordinates. This variability was not simply attributed to brain sizes or suture irregularities but instead reflected differences in cortical geography across animals. Our data thus indicate that functional mapping in individual animals is essential for dissecting cortical area-specific roles with high precision.",

		"abstract": "Human language stands out in the natural world as a biological signal that uses a structured system to combine the meanings of small linguistic units (e.g., words) into larger constituents (e.g., phrases and sentences). However, the physical dynamics of speech (or sign) do not stand in a one-to-one relationship with the meanings listeners perceive. Instead, listeners infer meaning based on their knowledge of the language. The neural readouts of the perceptual and cognitive processes underlying these inferences are still poorly understood. In the present study, we used scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to compare the neural response to phrases (e.g., the red vase) and sentences (e.g., the vase is red), which were close in semantic meaning and had been synthesized to be physically indistinguishable. Differences in structure were well captured in the reorganization of neural phase responses in delta (approximately <2 Hz) and theta bands (approximately 2 to 7 Hz),and in power and power connectivity changes in the alpha band (approximately 7.5 to 13.5 Hz). Consistent with predictions from a computational model, sentences showed more power, more power connectivity, and more phase synchronization than phrases did. Theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling occurred, but did not differ between the syntactic structures. Spectral-temporal response function (STRF) modeling revealed different encoding states for phrases and sentences, over and above the acoustically driven neural response. Our findings provide a comprehensive description of how the brain encodes and separates linguistic structures in the dynamics of neural responses. They imply that phase synchronization and strength of connectivity are readouts for the constituent structure of language. The results provide a novel basis for future neurophysiological research on linguistic structure representation in the brain, and, together with our simulations, support time-based binding as a mechanism of structure encoding in neural dynamics.",

		"abstract": "Ancient undeciphered scripts present problems of different nature, not just tied to linguistic identification. The undeciphered Cypro-Minoan script from second millennium BCE Cyprus, for instance, currently does not have a standardized, definitive inventory of signs, and, in addition, stands divided into three separate subgroups (CM1, CM2, CM3), which have also been alleged to record different languages. However, this state of the art is not consensually accepted by the experts. In this article, we aim to apply a method that can aid to shed light on the tripartite division, to assess if it holds up against a multi-pronged, multi-disciplinary approach. This involves considerations linked to paleography (shapes of individual signs) and epigraphy (writing style tied to the support used), and crucially, deep learning-based strategies. These automatic methods, which are widely adopted in many fields such as computer vision and computational linguistics, allow us to look from an innovative perspective at the specific issues presented by ancient, poorly understood scripts in general, and Cypro-Minoan in particular. The usage of a state-of-the-art convolutional neural model that is unsupervised, and therefore does not use any prior knowledge of the script, is still underrepresented in the study of undeciphered writing systems, and helps to investigate the tripartite division from a fresh standpoint. The conclusions we reached show that: 1. the use of different media skews to a large extent the uniformity of the sign shapes; 2. the application of several neural techniques confirm this, since they highlight graphic proximity among signs inscribed on similar supports; 3. multi-stranded approaches prove to be a successful tool to investigate ancient scripts whose language is still unidentified. More crucially, these aspects, together, point in the same direction, namely the validation of a unitary, single Cypro-Minoan script, rather than the current division into three subgroups.",

		"abstract": "Biologically important effects occur when proteins bind to other substances, of which binding to DNA is a crucial one. Therefore, accurate identification of protein-DNA binding residues is important for further understanding of the protein-DNA interaction mechanism. Although wet-lab methods can accurately obtain the location of bound residues, it requires significant human, financial and time costs. There is thus an urgent need to develop efficient computational-based methods. Most current state-of-the-art methods are two-step approaches: the first step uses a sliding window technique to extract residue features; the second step uses each residue as an input to the model for prediction. This has a negative impact on the efficiency of prediction and ease of use. In this study, we propose a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model that can input the entire protein sequence of variable length and use two modules, Transformer Encoder Block and Feature Extracting Block, for hierarchical feature extraction, where Transformer Encoder Block is used to extract global features, and then Feature Extracting Block is used to extract local features to further improve the recognition capability of the model. The comparison results on two benchmark datasets, namely PDNA-543 and PDNA-41, prove the effectiveness of our method in identifying protein-DNA binding residues.

		"abstract": "To attain goals, people must proactively prevent interferences and react to interferences once they occur. Whereas most research focuses on how people deal with external interferences, here we investigate the use of proactive and reactive control in dealing with unwanted thoughts. To examine this question, we asked people to generate an association to each of several repeating cue words, while forbidding the repetition of associations. Reactively rejecting and replacing unwanted repeated associations after they occur entails slower response times. Conversely, proactive control entails constricting the search space and thus faster response times. To gain further insight into different potential proactive thought control mechanisms, we augmented the analysis of raw response times with a novel, hypothesis-based, tractable computational model describing how people serially sample associations. Our results indicate that people primarily react to unwanted thoughts after they occur. Yet, we found evidence for two latent proactive control mechanisms: one that allows people to mitigate the episodic strengthening of repeated thoughts, and another that helps avoid looping in a repetitive thought. Exploratory analysis showed a relationship between model parameters and self-reported individual differences in the control over unwanted thoughts in daily life. The findings indicate the novel task and model can advance our understanding of how people can and cannot control their thoughts and memories, and benefit future research on the mechanisms responsible for unwanted thought in different psychiatric conditions. Finally, we discuss implications concerning the involvement of associative thinking and various control processes in semantic fluency, decision-making and creativity.",

		"abstract": "Networks of spiking neurons with adaption have been shown to be able to reproduce a wide range of neural activities, including the emergent population bursting and spike synchrony that underpin brain disorders and normal function. Exact mean-field models derived from spiking neural networks are extremely valuable, as such models can be used to determine how individual neurons and the network they reside within interact to produce macroscopic network behaviours. In the paper, we derive and analyze a set of exact mean-field equations for the neural network with spike frequency adaptation. Specifically, our model is a network of Izhikevich neurons, where each neuron is modeled by a two dimensional system consisting of a quadratic integrate and fire equation plus an equation which implements spike frequency adaptation. Previous work deriving a mean-field model for this type of network, relied on the assumption of sufficiently slow dynamics of the adaptation variable. However, this approximation did not succeed in establishing an exact correspondence between the macroscopic description and the realistic neural network, especially when the adaptation time constant was not large. The challenge lies in how to achieve a closed set of mean-field equations with the inclusion of the mean-field dynamics of the adaptation variable. We address this problem by using a Lorentzian ansatz combined with the moment closure approach to arrive at a mean-field system in the thermodynamic limit. The resulting macroscopic description is capable of qualitatively and quantitatively describing the collective dynamics of the neural network, including transition between states where the individual neurons exhibit asynchronous tonic firing and synchronous bursting. We extend the approach to a network of two populations of neurons and discuss the accuracy and efficacy of our mean-field approximations by examining all assumptions that are imposed during the derivation. Numerical bifurcation analysis of our mean-field models reveals bifurcations not previously observed in the models, including a novel mechanism for emergence of bursting in the network. We anticipate our results will provide a tractable and reliable tool to investigate the underlying mechanism of brain function and dysfunction from the perspective of computational neuroscience.",

		"abstract": "Emergence of suicidal symptoms has been reported as a potential antidepressant adverse drug reaction. Identifying risk factors associated could increase our understanding of this phenomenon and stratify individuals at higher risk. Logistic regressions were used to identify risk factors of self-reported treatment-attributed suicidal ideation (TASI). We then employed classifiers to test the predictive ability of the variables identified. A TASI GWAS, as well as SNP-based heritability estimation, were performed. GWAS replication was sought from an independent study. Significant associations were found for age and comorbid conditions, including bipolar and personality disorders. Participants reporting TASI from one antidepressant were more likely to report TASI from other antidepressants. No genetic loci associated with TAS I (p\u2009<\u20095e-8) were identified. Of 32 independent variants with suggestive association (p\u2009<\u20091e-5), 27 lead SNPs were available in a replication dataset from the GENDEP study. Only one variant showed a consistent effect and nominal association in the independent replication sample. Classifiers were able to stratify non-TASI from TASI participants (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.77) and those reporting treatment-attributed suicide attempts (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.85). The pattern of TASI co-occurrence across participants suggest nonspecific factors underlying its etiology. These findings provide insights into the underpinnings of TASI and serve as a proof-of-concept of the use of classifiers for risk stratification.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAutomatic segmentation of 3D objects in computed tomography is challenging. Current methods, based mainly on artificial intelligence (AI) and end-to-end deep learning networks, are weak in garnering high-level anatomic information, which leads to compromised efficiency and robustness. This can be overcome by incorporating natural intelligence (NI) into AI methods via computational models of human anatomic knowledge.\n\n\nPURPOSE\nWe formulate a hybrid intelligence (HI) approach that integrates the complementary strengths of NI and AI for organ segmentation in computed tomography (CT) images and illustrate performance in the application of radiation therapy (RT) planning via multi-site clinical evaluation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe system employs five modules: (i) Body region recognition (BRR), that automatically trims a given image to a precisely-defined target body region; (ii) NI-based automatic anatomy recognition (AAR-R), that performs object recognition in the trimmed image without deep learning and outputs a localized fuzzy model for each object; (iii) Deep learning-based recognition (DL-R), that refines the coarse recognition results of AAR-R and outputs a stack of 2D bounding boxes (BBs) for each object; (iv) Model morphing (MM), that deforms the AAR-R fuzzy model of each object guided by the BBs output by DL-R; and (v) DL-based delineation (DL-D), that employs the object containment information provided by MM to delineate each object. NI from (ii), AI from (i), (iii), and (v), and their combination from (iv), facilitate the HI-system.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe HI-system was tested on 26 organs in Neck and Thorax body regions on CT images obtained prospectively from 464 patients in a study involving four RT centers. Data sets from one separate independent institution involving 125 patients were employed in training/model building for each of the two body regions, while 104 and 110 data sets from the 4 RT centers were utilized for testing on Neck and Thorax, respectively. In the testing data sets, 83% of the images had limitations such as streak artifacts, poor contrast, shape distortion, pathology, or implants. The contours output by the HI-system were compared to contours drawn in clinical practice at the 4 RT centers by utilizing an independently established ground truth (GT) set of contours as reference. Three sets of measures were employed: accuracy via Dice Coefficient (DC) and Hausdorff boundary Distance (HD), subjective clinical acceptability via a blinded reader study, and efficiency by measuring human time saved in contouring by the HI-system. Overall, the HI-system achieved a mean DC of 0.78 and 0.87 and a mean HD of 2.22 mm and 4.53 mm for Neck and Thorax, respectively. It significantly outperformed clinical contouring in accuracy and saved overall 70% of human time over clinical contouring time, while acceptability scores varied significantly from site to site for both auto-contours and clinically drawn contours.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe HI-system is observed to behave like an expert human in robustness in the contouring task but vastly more efficiently. It seems to use NI help where image information alone will not suffice to decide, first for the correct localization of the object and then for the precise delineation of the boundary.

		"abstract": "Background and purpose\nIn (ultra-)hypofractionation, the contribution of intrafraction motion to treatment accuracy becomes increasingly important. Our purpose was to evaluate intrafraction motion and resulting geometric uncertainties for breast tumor (bed) and individual axillary lymph nodes, and to compare prone and supine position for the breast tumor (bed).\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nDuring 1-3\u00a0min of free breathing, we acquired transverse/sagittal interleaved 1.5\u00a0T cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast tumor (bed) in prone and supine position and coronal/sagittal cine MRI of individual axillary lymph nodes in supine position. A total of 31 prone and 23 supine breast cine MRI (in 23 women) and 52 lymph node cine MRI (in 24 women) were included. Maximum displacement, breathing amplitude, and drift were analyzed using deformable image registration. Geometric uncertainties were calculated for all displacements and for breathing motion only.\n\n\nResults\nMedian maximum displacements (range over the three orthogonal orientations) were 1.1-1.5\u00a0mm for the breast tumor (bed) in prone and 1.8-3.0\u00a0mm in supine position, and 2.2-2.4\u00a0mm for lymph nodes. Maximum displacements were significantly smaller in prone than in supine position, mainly due to smaller breathing amplitude: 0.6-0.9\u00a0mm in prone vs. 0.9-1.4\u00a0mm in supine. Systematic and random uncertainties were 0.1-0.4\u00a0mm in prone position and 0.2-0.8\u00a0mm in supine position for the tumor (bed), and 0.4-0.6\u00a0mm for the lymph nodes.\n\n\nConclusion\nIntrafraction motion of breast tumor (bed) and individual lymph nodes was small. Motion of the tumor (bed) was smaller in prone than in supine position.",

		"abstract": "Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) is an investigational therapy developed to circumvent the limitations of drug delivery to the brain. Catheters are used in CED to locally infuse therapeutic agents into brain tissue. CED has demonstrated clinical utility for treatment of malignant brain tumors; however, CED has been limited by lack of CED-specific catheters. Therefore, we developed a multiport, arborizing catheter to maximize drug distribution for CED. Using a multiphasic finite element (FE) framework, we parametrically determined the influence of design variables of the catheter on the dispersal volume of the infusion. We predicted dispersal volume of a solute infused in a permeable hyperelastic solid matrix, as a function of separation distance (ranging from 0.5 to 2.0\u2009cm) of imbedded infusion cavities that represented individual ports in a multiport catheter. To validate the model, we compared FE solutions of pressure-controlled infusions to experimental data of indigo carmine dye infused in agarose tissue phantoms. The Tc50, defined as the infusion time required for the normalized solute concentration between two sources to equal 50% of the prescribed concentration, was determined for simulations with infusion pressures ranging from 1 to 4\u2009kPa. In our validated model, we demonstrate that multiple ports increase dispersal volume with increasing port distance but are associated with a significant increase in infusion time. Tc50 increases approximately tenfold when doubling the port distance. Increasing the infusion flow rate (from 0.7\u2009\u03bcL/min to 8.48\u2009\u03bcL/min) can mitigate the increased infusion time. In conclusion, a compromise of port distance and flow rate could improve infusion duration and dispersal volume.",

		"abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is increasingly being diagnosed in both children and adults, but the neural mechanisms that underlie its distinct symptoms and whether children and adults share the same mechanism remain poorly understood. Here, we used a nested-spectral partition approach to study resting-state brain networks of ADHD patients (n\u00a0= 97) and healthy controls (HCs, n\u00a0= 97) across the lifespan (7-50 years). Compared to the linear lifespan associations of brain segregation and integration with age in HCs, ADHD patients have a quadratic association in the whole-brain and in most functional systems, whereas the limbic system dominantly affected by ADHD has a linear association. Furthermore, the limbic system better predicts hyperactivity, and the salient attention system better predicts inattention. These predictions are shared in children and adults with ADHD. Our findings reveal a lifespan association of brain networks with ADHD and provide potential shared neural bases of distinct ADHD symptoms in children and adults.",

Using high-throughput sequencing (HTS)-based methods like Hi-C, active or inactive compartments and open or closed topologically associating domain (TAD) structures can be identified on a cell population level. Recently developed high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) molecular imaging techniques such as 3D electron microscopy with in situ hybridization (3D-EMSIH) and 3D structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) enable direct detection of physical representations of chromatin structures in a single cell. However, computational analysis of 3D image data with explainability and interpretability on functional characteristics of chromatin structures is still challenging. We developed Extracting Physical-Characteristics from Images of Chromatin Structures (EPICS), a machine-learning based computational method for processing high-resolution chromatin 3D image data. Using EPICS on images produced by 3D-EMISH or 3D-SIM techniques, we generated more direct 3D representations of higher-order chromatin structures, identified major chromatin domains, and determined the open or closed status of each domain. We identified several high-contributing features from the model as the major physical characteristics that define the open or closed chromatin domains, demonstrating the explainability and interpretability of EPICS. EPICS can be applied to the analysis of other high-resolution 3D molecular imaging data for spatial genomics studies. The R and Python codes of EPICS are available at\u00a0https://github.com/zang-lab/epics.",

		"abstract": "RNA-protein interactions play vital roles in driving the cellular machineries. Despite significant involvement in several biological processes, the underlying molecular mechanism of RNA-protein interactions is still elusive. This may be due to the experimental difficulties in solving co-crystallized RNA-protein complexes. Inherent flexibility of RNA molecules to adopt different conformations makes them functionally diverse. Their interactions with protein have implications in RNA disease biology. Thus, study of binding interfaces can provide a mechanistic insight of the molecular functioning and aberrations caused due to altered interactions. Moreover, high-throughput sequencing technologies have generated huge sequence data compared to available structural data of RNA-protein complexes. In such a scenario, efficient computational algorithms are required for identification of protein-binding interfaces of RNA in the absence of known structures. We have investigated several machine learning classifiers and various features derived from nucleotide sequences to identify protein-binding nucleotides in RNA. We achieve best performance with nucleotide-triplet and nucleotide-quartet feature-based random forest models. An overall accuracy of 84.8%, sensitivity of 83.2%, specificity of 86.1%, MCC of 0.70 and AUC of 0.93 is achieved.

		"abstract": "Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is a newly discovered protein post-translational modification and has been proved to be widely involved in various biological processes and human diseases. Thus, the accurate and fast identification of this modification became the preliminary task in investigating the related biological functions. Due to the long duration, high cost and intensity of traditional high-throughput experimental techniques, constructing bioinformatics predictors based on machine learning algorithms is treated as a most popular solution. Although dozens of predictors have been reported to identify Kcr sites, only two, nhKcr and DeepKcrot, focused on human nonhistone protein sequences. Moreover, due to the imbalance nature of data distribution, associated detection performance is severely biased towards the major negative samples and remains much room for improvement. In this research, we developed a convolutional neural network framework, dubbed iKcr_CNN, to identify the human nonhistone Kcr modification. To overcome the imbalance issue (Kcr: 15,274; non-Kcr: 74,018 with imbalance ratio: 1:4), we applied the focal loss function instead of the standard cross-entropy as the indicator to optimize the model, which not only assigns different weights to samples belonging to different categories but also distinguishes easy- and hard-classified samples. Ultimately, the obtained model presents more balanced prediction scores between real-world positive and negative samples than existing tools. The user-friendly web server is accessible at ikcrcnn.webmalab.cn/, and the involved Python scripts can be conveniently downloaded at github.com/lijundou/iKcr_CNN/. The proposed model may serve as an efficient tool to assist academicians with their experimental researches.",

		"abstract": "The need for reproducible, credible, multiscale biological modeling has led to the development of standardized simulation platforms, such as the widely-used NEURON environment for computational neuroscience. Developing and maintaining NEURON over several decades has required attention to the competing needs of backwards compatibility, evolving computer architectures, the addition of new scales and physical processes, accessibility to new users, and efficiency and flexibility for specialists. In order to meet these challenges, we have now substantially modernized NEURON, providing continuous integration, an improved build system and release workflow, and better documentation. With the help of a new source-to-source compiler of the NMODL domain-specific language we have enhanced NEURON's ability to run efficiently, via the CoreNEURON simulation engine, on a variety of hardware platforms, including GPUs. Through the implementation of an optimized in-memory transfer mechanism this performance optimized backend is made easily accessible to users, providing training and model-development paths from laptop to workstation to supercomputer and cloud platform. Similarly, we have been able to accelerate NEURON's reaction-diffusion simulation performance through the use of just-in-time compilation. We show that these efforts have led to a growing developer base, a simpler and more robust software distribution, a wider range of supported computer architectures, a better integration of NEURON with other scientific workflows, and substantially improved performance for the simulation of biophysical and biochemical models.",

		"abstract": "In relation to intravitreal drug delivery, predictive mathematical models for drug transport are being developed, and to effectively implement these for retinal delivery, the information on biophysical properties of various ocular tissues is fundamentally important. It is therefore necessary to accurately measure the diffusion coefficient of drugs and drug surrogates in the vitreous humor. In this review, we present the studies conducted by various researchers on such measurements over the last several decades. These include imaging techniques (fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) that make use of introducing a contrast agent or a labeled drug into the vitreous and tracking its diffusive movement at various time points. A predictive model for the same initial conditions when matched with the experimental measurements provides the diffusion coefficient, leading to results for various molecules ranging in size from approximately 0.1 to 160\u2009kDa. For real drugs, the effectiveness of this system depends on the successful labeling of the drugs with suitable contrast agents such as fluorescein and gadolinium or manganese so that fluorescence or MR imagining could be conducted. Besides this technique, some work has been carried out using the diffusion apparatus for measuring permeation of a drug across an excised vitreous body from a donor chamber to the receptor by sampling assays from the chambers at various time intervals. This has the advantage of not requiring labeling but is otherwise more disruptive to the vitreous. Some success with nanoparticles has been achieved using dynamic light scattering (DLS), and presently, radioactive labeling is being explored.",

		"abstract": "Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has been widely employed to examine brain functional connectivity (FC) alterations in various neurological disorders. At present, various computational methods have been proposed to estimate connectivity strength between different brain regions, as the edge weight of FC networks. However, little is known about which model is more sensitive to Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. This study comparatively characterized topological properties of rs-FC networks constructed with Pearson correlation (PC), dynamic time warping (DTW), and group information guided independent component analysis (GIG-ICA), aimed at investigating the sensitivity and effectivity of these methods in differentiating AD stages. A total of 54 subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ANDI) database, divided into healthy control (HC), mild cognition impairment (MCI), and AD groups, were included in this study. Network-level (global efficiency and characteristic path length) and nodal (clustering coefficient) metrics were used to capture groupwise difference across HC, MCI, and AD groups. The results showed that almost no significant differences were found according to global efficiency and characteristic path length. However, in terms of clustering coefficient, 52 brain parcels sensitive to AD progression were identified in rs-FC networks built with GIG-ICA, much more than PC (6 parcels) and DTW (3 parcels). This indicates that GIG-ICA is more sensitive to AD progression than PC and DTW. The findings also confirmed that the AD-linked FC alterations mostly appeared in temporal, cingulate, and angular areas, which might contribute to clinical diagnosis of AD. Overall, this study provides insights into the topological properties of rs-FC networks over AD progression, suggesting that FC strength estimation of FC networks cannot be neglected in AD-related graph analysis.",

		"abstract": "Occupational exposures to toxicants are estimated to cause over 370\u00a0000 premature deaths annually. The risks due to multiple workplace chemical exposures and those occupations most susceptible to the resulting health effects remain poorly characterized. The aim of this study is to identify occupations with elevated toxicant biomarker concentrations and increased health risk associated with toxicant exposures in a diverse working US population. For this observational study of 51\u00a0008 participants, we used data from the 1999-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We characterized differences in chemical exposures by occupational group for 131 chemicals by applying a series of generalized linear models with the outcome as biomarker concentrations and the main predictor as the occupational groups, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, poverty income ratio, study period, and biomarker of tobacco use. For each occupational group, we calculated percentages of participants with chemical biomarker levels exceeding acceptable health-based guidelines. Blue-collar workers from \"Construction,\" \"Professional, Scientific, Technical Services,\" \"Real Estate, Rental, Leasing,\" \"Manufacturing,\" and \"Wholesale Trade\" have higher biomarker levels of toxicants such as several heavy metals, acrylamide, glycideamide, and several volatile organic compounds (VOCs) compared with their white-collar counterparts. Moreover, blue-collar workers from these industries have toxicant concentrations exceeding acceptable levels: arsenic (16%-58%), lead (1%-3%), cadmium (1%-11%), glycideamide (3%-6%), and VOCs (1%-33%). Blue-collar workers have higher toxicant levels relative to their white-collar counterparts, often exceeding acceptable levels associated with noncancer effects. Our findings identify multiple occupations to prioritize for targeted interventions and health policies to monitor and reduce toxicant exposures.",

		"abstract": "Crop leaf diseases can reflect the current health status of the crop, and the rapid and automatic detection of field diseases has become one of the difficulties in the process of industrialization of agriculture. In the widespread application of various machine learning techniques, recognition time consumption and accuracy remain the main challenges in moving agriculture toward industrialization. This article proposes a novel network architecture called YOLO V5-CAcT to identify crop diseases. The fast and efficient lightweight YOLO V5 is chosen as the base network. Repeated Augmentation, FocalLoss, and SmoothBCE strategies improve the model robustness and combat the positive and negative sample ratio imbalance problem. Early Stopping is used to improve the convergence of the model. We use two technical routes of model pruning, knowledge distillation and memory activation parameter compression ActNN for model training and identification under different hardware conditions. Finally, we use simplified operators with INT8 quantization for further optimization and deployment in the deep learning inference platform NCNN to form an industrial-grade solution. In addition, some samples from the Plant Village and AI Challenger datasets were applied to build our dataset. The average recognition accuracy of 94.24% was achieved in images of 59 crop disease categories for 10 crop species, with an average inference time of 1.563 ms per sample and model size of only 2 MB, reducing the model size by 88% and the inference time by 72% compared with the original model, with significant performance advantages. Therefore, this study can provide a solid theoretical basis for solving the common problems in current agricultural disease image detection. At the same time, the advantages in terms of accuracy and computational cost can meet the needs of agricultural industrialization.",

		"abstract": "Myosin binding protein-C (MyBP-C) is a sarcomeric protein which regulates the force of contraction in striated muscles. Mutations in the MYBPC family of genes, including slow skeletal (MYBPC1), fast skeletal (MYBPC2) and cardiac (MYBPC3), can result in cardiac and skeletal myopathies. Nonetheless, their evolutionary pattern, pathogenicity and impact on MyBP-C protein structure remain to be elucidated. Therefore, the present study aimed to systematically assess the evolutionarily conserved and epigenetic patterns of MYBPC family mutations. Leveraging a machine learning (ML) approach, the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) provided variants in MYBPC1, MYBPC2, and MYBPC3 genes. This was followed by an analysis with Ensembl's variant effect predictor (VEP), resulting in the identification of 8,618, 3,871, and 3,071 variants in MYBPC1, MYBPC2, and MYBPC3, respectively. Missense variants comprised 61%-66% of total variants in which the third nucleotide positions in the codons were highly altered. Arginine was the most mutated amino acid, important because most disease-causing mutations in MyBP-C proteins are arginine in origin. Domains C5 and C6 of MyBP-C were found to be hotspots for most mutations in the MyBP-C family of proteins. A high percentage of truncated mutations in cMyBP-C cause cardiomyopathies. Arginine and glutamate were the top hits in fMyBP-C and cMyBP-C, respectively, and tryptophan and tyrosine were the most common among the three paralogs changing to premature stop codons and causing protein truncations at the carboxyl terminus. A heterogeneous epigenetic pattern was identified among the three MYBP-C paralogs. Overall, it was shown that databases using computational approaches can facilitate diagnosis and drug discovery to treat muscle disorders caused by MYBPC mutations.",

		"abstract": "With therapeutic trials on the horizon for Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A), reliable, valid, and responsive clinical outcome assessments and biomarkers are essential. Accelerate Clinical Trials in CMT (ACT-CMT) is an international study designed to address important gaps in CMT1A clinical trial readiness including the lack of a validated, responsive functional outcome measure for adults, and a lack of validated biomarkers for multicenter application in clinical trials in CMT1A. The primary aims of ACT-CMT include validation of the Charcot-Marie-Tooth Functional Outcome Measure, magnetic resonance imaging of intramuscular fat accumulation as a lower limb motor biomarker, and in-vivo reflectance confocal microscopy of Meissner corpuscle sensory receptor density, a sensory biomarker. Initial studies have indicated that these measures are feasible, reliable and valid. A large prospective, multi-site study is necessary to fully validate and examine the responsiveness of these outcome measures in relation to existing outcomes for use in future clinical trials involving individuals with CMT1A. Two hundred 15 adults with CMT1A are being recruited to participate in this prospective, international, multi-center study. Serial assessments, up to 3 years, are performed and include the CMT-FOM, CMT Exam Score-Rasch, Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale, CMT-Health Index, as well as nerve conduction studies, and magnetic resonance imaging and Meissner corpuscle biomarkers. Correlations using baseline data will be examined for validity. Longitudinal analyses will document the changes in function, intramuscular fat accumulation, Meissner corpuscle sensory receptor density. Lastly, we will use anchor-based and other statistical methods to determine the minimally clinically important change for these clinical outcome assessments and biomarkers in CMT1A. Reliable, and responsive clinical outcome assessments of function and disease progression biomarkers are urgently needed for application in early and late phase clinical trials in CMT1A. The ACT-CMT study protocol will address this need through the prospective, longitudinal, multicenter examination in unprecedented detail of novel and existing clinical outcome assessments and motor and sensory biomarkers, and enhance international clinical trial infrastructure, training and preparedness for future therapeutic trials in CMT and related neuropathies.",

We applied a method for 3D/3D image transformation to map all gene expression patterns to a single reference embryo for each stage providing both visual analysis and volumetric mapping allowing computational methods to interrogate the combined expression patterns. We identify novel territories where multiple Wnt and Fzd genes are co-expressed and cross-compare all patterns, including all seven Wnt paralogous gene pairs. The comprehensive analysis allows regions in the embryo where no Wnt or Fzd gene expression is detected, and where single Wnt genes are uniquely expressed, to be revealed.

		"abstract": "Attentional priming has a dominating influence on vision, speeding visual search, releasing items from crowding, reducing masking effects, and during free-choice, primed targets are chosen over unprimed ones. Many accounts postulate that templates stored in working memory control what we attend to and mediate the priming. But what is the nature of these templates (or representations)? Analyses of real-world visual scenes suggest that tuning templates to exact color or luminance values would be impractical since those can vary greatly because of changes in environmental circumstances and perceptual interpretation. Tuning templates to a range of the most probable values would be more efficient. Recent evidence does indeed suggest that the visual system represents such probability, gradually encoding statistical variation in the environment through repeated exposure to input statistics. This is consistent with evidence from neurophysiology and theoretical neuroscience as well as computational evidence of probabilistic representations in visual perception. I argue that such probabilistic representations are the unit of attentional priming and that priming of, say, a repeated single-color value simply involves priming of a distribution with no variance. This \"priming of probability\" view can be modelled within a Bayesian framework where priming provides contextual priors. Priming can therefore be thought of as learning of the underlying probability density function of the target or distractor sets in a given continuous task.",

		"abstract": "The effects of smoking on survival in BM patients have yet to be reviewed and meta-analysed. However, previous studies have shown that smokers had a greater risk of dying from lung cancer compared to non-smokers. This meta-analysis, therefore, aimed to analyse the effects of cigarette smoking on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in lung cancer BM patients. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane and Google Scholar were searched for comparative studies regarding the effects of smoking on incidence and survival in brain metastases patients up to December 2020. Three independent reviewers extracted overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival data (PFS). Random-effects models were used to pool multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HR). Out of 1890 studies, fifteen studies with a total of 2915 patients met our inclusion criteria. Amongst lung carcinoma BM patients, those who were smokers (ever or yes) had a worse overall survival (HR: 1.34, 95% CI 1.13, 1.60, I2: 72.1%, p-heterogeneity\u2009<\u20090.001) than those who were non-smokers (never or no). A subgroup analysis showed the association to remain significant in the ever/never subgroup (HR: 1.34, 95% CI 1.11, 1.63) but not in the yes/no smoking subgroup (HR: 1.30, 95% CI 0.44, 3.88). This difference between the two subgroups was not statistically significant (p\u2009=\u20090.91). Amongst lung carcinoma BM patients, smoking was associated with a worse OS and PFS. Future studies examining BMs should report survival data stratified by uniform smoking status definitions.",

		"abstract": "Hyperspectral imaging enables many versatile applications for its competence in capturing abundant spatial and spectral information, which is crucial for identifying substances. However, the devices for acquiring hyperspectral images are typically expensive and very complicated, hindering the promotion of their application in consumer electronics, such as daily food inspection and point-of-care medical screening, etc. Recently, many computational spectral imaging methods have been proposed by directly reconstructing the hyperspectral information from widely available RGB images. These reconstruction methods can exclude the usage of burdensome spectral camera hardware while keeping a high spectral resolution and imaging performance. We present a thorough investigation of more than 25 state-of-the-art spectral reconstruction methods which are categorized as prior-based and data-driven methods. Simulations on open-source datasets show that prior-based methods are more suitable for rare data situations, while data-driven methods can unleash the full potential of deep learning in big data cases. We have identified current challenges faced by those methods (e.g., loss function, spectral accuracy, data generalization) and summarized a few trends for future work. With the rapid expansion in datasets and the advent of more advanced neural networks, learnable methods with fine feature representation abilities are very promising. This comprehensive review can serve as a fruitful reference source for peer researchers, thus paving the way for the development of computational hyperspectral imaging.",

		"abstract": "To predict adverse neurodevelopmental outcome of very preterm neonates. A total of 166 preterm neonates born between 24-32\u00a0weeks' gestation underwent brain MRI early in life. Radiomics features were extracted from T1- and T2- weighted images. Motor, cognitive, and language outcomes were assessed at a corrected age of 18 and 33\u00a0months and 4.5\u00a0years. Elastic Net was implemented to select the clinical and radiomic features that best predicted outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was used to determine the predictive ability of each feature set. Clinical variables predicted cognitive outcome at 18\u00a0months with AUROC 0.76 and motor outcome at 4.5\u00a0years with AUROC 0.78. T1-radiomics features showed better prediction than T2-radiomics on the total motor outcome at 18\u00a0months and gross motor outcome at 33\u00a0months (AUROC: 0.81 vs 0.66 and 0.77 vs 0.7). T2-radiomics features were superior in two 4.5-year motor outcomes (AUROC: 0.78 vs 0.64 and 0.8 vs 0.57). Combining clinical parameters and radiomics features improved model performance in motor outcome at 4.5\u00a0years (AUROC: 0.84 vs 0.8). Radiomic features outperformed clinical variables for the prediction of adverse motor outcomes. Adding clinical variables to the radiomics model enhanced predictive performance.",

		"abstract": "Hevin is a secreted extracellular matrix protein that is encoded by the SPARCL1 gene. Recent studies have shown that Hevin plays an important role in regulating synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Mutations in the SPARCL1 gene increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the molecular basis of how mutations in SPARCL1 increase the risk of ASD is not been fully understood. In this study, we show that one of the SPARCL1 mutations associated with ASD impairs normal Hevin secretion. We identified Hevin mutants lacking the EF-hand motif through analyzing ASD-related mice with vulnerable spliceosome functions. Hevin deletion mutants accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to the activation of unfolded protein responses. We also found that a single amino acid substitution of Trp647 with Arg in the EF-hand motif associated with a familial case of ASD causes a similar phenotype in the EF-hand deletion mutant. Importantly, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation revealed that this single amino acid substitution triggers exposure of a hydrophobic amino acid to the surface, increasing the binding of Hevin with molecular chaperons, BIP. Taken together, these data suggest that the integrity of the EF-hand motif in Hevin is crucial for proper folding and that ASD-related mutations impair the export of Hevin from the ER. Our data provide a novel mechanism linking a point mutation in the SPARCL1 gene to the molecular and cellular characteristics involved in ASD.",

Retrospective blinded comparison of exophthalmos measurements on axial CT with Hertel exophthalmometry measurements in 113 patients. Descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney-U test were employed for analysis. Mean difference of proptosis between both eyes was 2.4 (SD\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0)\u00a0mm in CT and 2.2 (SD\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0)\u00a0mm in Hertel measurements. Proptosis of 0-2\u00a0mm was present in 69 (61.1%), and\u2009>\u20092\u00a0mm in 42 (38.9%) patients in Hertel measurements (CT 64 (56.6%), and 49 (43.4%) patients). Pearson's coefficient showed a correlation of 0.793 between both methods (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Accuracy of Hertel measurement depended significantly from the examiners' experience (<\u20095 (group 1), 5-15 (2) and\u2009>\u200925 (3) years, p\u2009=\u20090.042, Kruskal-Wallis analysis; p\u2009=\u20090.086 group 1 vs. 2, p\u2009=\u20090.014 group 1 vs. 3, p\u2009=\u20090.688 group 2 vs. 3, Mann-Whitney-U-test), reflected by levels of Pearson's coefficient (correlation of both methods 0.691 (group 1), 0.837 (2) and 0.831 (3), respectively, p\u2009=\u20090.01). Generally, Hertel exophthalmometry correlates well with CT measurements. Subgroup analysis confirmed a superior quality of Hertel measurements in favour of experienced examiners. Teaching of accurate Hertel exophthalmometry should be improved. Assessment of exophthalmos using standardized criteria should be implemented for imaging reports.",

		"abstract": "Sign language recognition is challenged by problems, such as accurate tracking of hand gestures, occlusion of hands, and high computational cost. Recently, it has benefited from advancements in deep learning techniques. However, these larger complex approaches cannot manage long-term sequential data and they are characterized by poor information processing and learning efficiency in capturing useful information. To overcome these challenges, we propose an integrated MediaPipe-optimized gated recurrent unit (MOPGRU) model for Indian sign language recognition. Specifically, we improved the update gate of the standard GRU cell by multiplying it by the reset gate to discard the redundant information from the past in one screening. By obtaining feedback from the resultant of the reset gate, additional attention is shown to the present input. Additionally, we replace the hyperbolic tangent activation in standard GRUs with exponential linear unit activation and SoftMax with Softsign activation in the output layer of the GRU cell. Thus, our proposed MOPGRU model achieved better prediction accuracy, high learning efficiency, information processing capability, and faster convergence than other sequential models.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND\nCompulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder (CSBD) was recently included in ICD-11 as a new impulse control disorder. While this certainly improved the diagnosis of CSBD, the underlying brain mechanisms of the disorder are still poorly understood. Better description of brain functional deficits is required.\n\n\nAIM\nHere we investigate patterns of resting-state brain functional connectivity (fc) in a group of CSBD patients compared to a group of healthy controls (HC).\n\n\nMETHODS\nA MATLAB toolbox named CONN functional connectivity toolbox was employed to study patterns of brain connectivity. Also correlation between fc and severity of CSBD symptoms and other psychological characteristics, assessed with questionnaires, were examined.\n\n\nOUTCOMES\nWe collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 81 heterosexual males: 52 CSBD patients and 29 HC.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe found increased fc between left inferior frontal gyrus and right planum temporale and polare, right and left insula, right Supplementary Motor Cortex (SMA), right parietal operculum, and also between left supramarginal gyrus and right planum polare, and between left orbitofrontal cortex and left insula when compared CSBD and HC. The decreased fc was observed between left middle temporal gyrus and bilateral insula and right parietal operculum. No significant correlations between psychological questionnaires assessing CSBD symptoms and resting-state functional connectivity were observed.\n\n\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS\nResults from our study extend the knowledge of brain mechanisms differentiating CSBD from HC.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS\nThe study was the first large sample study showing 5 distinct functional brain networks differentiating CSBD patients and HC. However, the sample was limited only to heterosexual men, in the future a greater diversity in studied sample and longitudinal studies are needed. Also, the present study examined functional connectivity at the level of regions of interest (ROIs). Future studies could verify these results by examining functional connectivity at the voxel level.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe identified functional brain networks differentiate CSBD from HC and provide some support for incentive sensitization as mechanism underlying CSBD symptoms. The correlation between psychological assessment (ie, severity of CSBD, depression and anxiety symptoms, level of impulsivity and compulsivity) and resting-state functional connectivity need further examination.

		"abstract": "Atypical sensory processing is now thought to be a core feature of the autism spectrum. Influential theories have proposed that both increased and decreased neural response reliability within sensory systems could underlie altered sensory processing in autism. Here, we report evidence for abnormally increased reliability of visual-evoked responses in layer 2/3 neurons of adult male and female primary visual cortex in the MECP2-duplication syndrome animal model of autism. Increased response reliability was due in part to decreased response amplitude, decreased fluctuations in endogenous activity, and an abnormal decoupling of visual-evoked activity from endogenous activity. Similar to what was observed neuronally, the optokinetic reflex occurred more reliably at low contrasts in mutant mice compared to controls. Retinal responses did not explain our observations. These data suggest that the circuit mechanisms for combining sensory-evoked and endogenous signal and noise processes may be altered in this form of syndromic autism.SIGNIFICANT STATEMENT:Atypical sensory processing is now thought to be a core feature of the autism spectrum. Influential theories have proposed that both increased and decreased neural response reliability within sensory systems could underlie altered sensory processing in autism. Here, we report evidence for abnormally increased reliability of visual-evoked responses in primary visual cortex of the animal model for MECP2-duplication syndrome, a high-penetrance single-gene cause of autism. Visual-evoked activity was abnormally decoupled from endogenous activity in mutant mice, suggesting in line with the influential \"hypo-priors\" theory of autism that sensory priors embedded in endogenous activity may have less influence on perception in autism.",

		"abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nMultisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is the result of an immune response triggered by a prior exposure to the SARS-CoV-2. The clinical presentation of MIS-C overlaps with other life-threatening bacterial infections, in which antimicrobials are the mainstay therapy. The aim of study was to describe the use of antibiotics in children with MIS-C in Poland.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe analysis of 345 children reported from 42 Polish cities to the national MultiOrgan Inflammatory Syndromes COVID-19 Related Study (MOIS-CoR Study) from June 2020 to April 2021.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt least one antibiotic was used in 310 (90%) children, mainly third-generation cephalosporin (251/310). Broad-spectrum antibiotics were used in 258 (75%) children and 224 (87%) received this treatment for more than three days. Concentrations of serum procalcitonin >2\u00b5g/L and presence of lower respiratory symptoms were associated with increased odds of receiving any antibiotic.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough bacterial infections in MIS-C patients are uncommon, we show that MIS-C poses a challenge to clinicians faced with the decision to start, continue, or stop antimicrobial therapy. Antibiotic stewardship in MIS-C patients should be improved to ensure that likely pathogens are treated and that antimicrobials are stopped when bacterial infections are excluded and the diagnosis of MIS-C is made.",

Computational approaches to developing and designing these molecules are being increasingly used to complement traditional lab-based processes. Nowadays, in silico methods fill multiple elements of the discovery stage, such as characterizing antibody-antigen interactions and identifying developability liabilities. Recently, computational methods tackling such problems have begun to follow machine learning paradigms, in many cases deep learning specifically. This paradigm shift offers improvements in established areas such as structure or binding prediction and opens up new possibilities such as language-based modeling of antibody repertoires or machine-learning-based generation of novel sequences.

		"abstract": "Exposure to MHC-antigen complexes on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs) activates T cells, inducing the formation of the immune synapse (IS). Antigen detection at the APC surface is thus a critical step in the adaptive immune response. The physical properties of antigen presenting surfaces encountered by T cells in vivo are believed to modulate T cell activation and proliferation. Although stiffness and ligand mobility influence IS formation, the effect of the complex topography of the APC surface on this process is not well understood. Here, we investigate how nanotopography modulates cytoskeletal dynamics and signaling during the early stages of T cell activation using high-resolution fluorescence microscopy on nanofabricated surfaces with parallel nanoridges of different spacings. We find that although nanoridges reduce the maximum spread area as compared to cells on flat surfaces, the ridges enhance the accumulation of actin and the signaling kinase ZAP-70 at the IS. Actin polymerization is more dynamic in the presence of ridges, which influence the directionality of both actin flows and microtubule growth. Our results demonstrate that the topography of the activating surface exerts both global effects on T cell morphology and local changes in actin and microtubule dynamics, collectively influencing T cell signaling.

		"abstract": "Machine learning is widely used for personalisation, that is, to tune systems with the aim of adapting their behaviour to the responses of humans. This tuning relies on quantified features that capture the human actions, and also on objective functions-that is, proxies - that are intended to represent desirable outcomes. However, a learning system's representation of the world can be incomplete or insufficiently rich, for example if users' decisions are based on properties of which the system is unaware. Moreover, the incompleteness of proxies can be argued to be an intrinsic property of computational systems, as they are based on literal representations of human actions rather than on the human actions themselves; this problem is distinct from the usual aspects of bias that are examined in machine learning literature. We use mathematical analysis and simulations of a reinforcement-learning case study to demonstrate that incompleteness of representation can, first, lead to learning that is no better than random; and second, means that the learning system can be inherently unaware that it is failing. This result has implications for the limits and applications of machine learning systems in human domains.",

		"abstract": "Confounding factors exist widely in various biological data owing to technical variations, population structures and experimental conditions. Such factors may mask the true signals and lead to spurious associations in the respective biological data, making it necessary to adjust confounding factors accordingly. However, existing confounder correction methods were mainly developed based on the original data or the pairwise Euclidean distance, either one of which is inadequate for analyzing different types of data, such as sequencing data. In this work, we proposed a method called Adjustment for Confounding factors using Principal Coordinate Analysis, or AC-PCoA, which reduces data dimension and extracts the information from different distance measures using principal coordinate analysis, and adjusts confounding factors across multiple datasets by minimizing the associations between lower-dimensional representations and confounding variables. Application of the proposed method was further extended to classification and prediction. We demonstrated the efficacy of AC-PCoA on three simulated datasets and five real datasets. Compared to the existing methods, AC-PCoA shows better results in visualization, statistical testing, clustering, and classification.",

		"abstract": "The recent advancements in sequencing technologies and informatic tools promoted a paradigm shift to decipher the hidden biological mysteries and transformed the biological issues into digital data to express both qualitative and quantitative forms. The transcriptomic approach, in particular, has added new dimensions to the versatile essence of plant genomics through the large and deep transcripts generated in the process. This has enabled the mining of super families from the sequenced plants, both model and non-model, understanding their ancestry, diversity, and evolution. The elucidation of the crystal structure of the WRKY proteins and recent advancement in computational prediction through homology modeling and molecular dynamic simulation has provided an insight into the DNA-protein complex formation, stability, and interaction, thereby giving a new dimension in understanding the WRKY regulation. The present review summarizes the functional aspects of the high volume of sequence data of WRKY transcription factors studied from different species, till date. The review focuses on the dynamics of structural classification and lineage in light of the recent information. Additionally, a comparative analysis approach was incorporated to understand the functions of the identified WRKY transcription factors subjected to abiotic (heat, cold, salinity, senescence, dark, wounding, UV, and carbon starvation) stresses as revealed through various sets of studies on different plant species. The review will be instrumental in understanding the events of evolution and the importance of WRKY TFs under the threat of climate change, considering the new scientific evidences to propose a fresh perspective.",

However, so far, a global view of AD-associated metabolic changes in the brain has been missing.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe metabolically profiled 500 samples from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Metabolite levels were correlated with eight clinical parameters, covering both late-life cognitive performance and AD neuropathology measures.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe observed widespread metabolic dysregulation associated with AD, spanning 298 metabolites from various AD-relevant pathways. These included alterations to bioenergetics, cholesterol metabolism, neuroinflammation, and metabolic consequences of neurotransmitter ratio imbalances. Our findings further suggest impaired osmoregulation as a potential pathomechanism in AD. Finally, inspecting the interplay of proteinopathies provided evidence that metabolic associations were largely driven by tau pathology rather than amyloid beta pathology.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThis work provides a comprehensive reference map of metabolic brain changes in AD that lays the foundation for future mechanistic follow-up studies.",

		"abstract": "Identifying factors whose fluctuations are associated with choice inconsistency is a major issue for rational decision theory. Here, we investigated the neuro-computational mechanisms through which mood fluctuations may bias human choice behavior. Intracerebral EEG data were collected in a large group of subjects (n = 30), while they were performing interleaved quiz and choice tasks that were designed to examine how a series of unrelated feedbacks affects decisions between safe and risky options. Neural baseline activity preceding choice onset was confronted first to mood level, estimated by a computational model integrating the feedbacks received in the quiz task, and then to the weighting of option attributes, in a computational model predicting risk attitude in the choice task. Results showed that 1) elevated broadband gamma activity (BGA) in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsal anterior insula (daIns) was respectively signaling periods of high and low mood, 2) increased vmPFC and daIns BGA respectively promoted and tempered risk taking by overweighting gain versus loss prospects. Thus, incidental feedbacks induce brain states that correspond to different moods and bias the evaluation of risky options. More generally, these findings might explain why people experiencing positive (or negative) outcome in some part of their life tend to expect success (or failure) in any other.",

		"abstract": "Immortal cancer cell lines (CCLs) are the most widely used system for investigating cancer biology and for the preclinical development of oncology therapies. Pharmacogenomic and genome-wide editing screenings have facilitated the discovery of clinically relevant gene-drug interactions and novel therapeutic targets via large panels of extensively characterised CCLs. However, tailoring pharmacological strategies in a precision medicine context requires bridging the existing gaps between tumours and in\u2009vitro models. Indeed, intrinsic limitations of CCLs such as misidentification, the absence of tumour microenvironment and genetic drift have highlighted the need to identify the most faithful CCLs for each primary tumour while addressing their heterogeneity, with the development of new models where necessary. Here, we discuss the most significant limitations of CCLs in representing patient features, and we review computational methods aiming at systematically evaluating the suitability of CCLs as tumour proxies and identifying the best patient representative in\u2009vitro models. Additionally, we provide an overview of the applications of these methods to more complex models and discuss future machine-learning-based directions that could resolve some of the arising discrepancies.",

		"abstract": "Visual perception remains stable across saccadic eye movements, despite the concurrent strongly disruptive visual flow. This stability is partially associated with a reduction in visual sensitivity, known as saccadic suppression, which already starts in the retina with reduced ganglion cell sensitivity. However, the retinal circuit mechanisms giving rise to such suppression remain unknown. Here, we describe these mechanisms using electrophysiology in mouse, pig, and macaque retina, 2-photon calcium imaging, computational modeling, and human psychophysics. We find that sequential stimuli, like those that naturally occur during saccades, trigger three independent suppressive mechanisms in the retina. The main mechanism is triggered by contrast-reversing sequential stimuli and originates within the receptive field center of ganglion cells. It does not involve inhibition or other known suppressive mechanisms like saturation or adaptation. Instead, it relies on temporal filtering of the inherently slow response of cone photoreceptors coupled with downstream nonlinearities. Two further mechanisms of suppression are present predominantly in ON ganglion cells and originate in the receptive field surround, highlighting another disparity between ON and OFF ganglion cells. The mechanisms uncovered here likely play a role in shaping the retinal output following eye movements and other natural viewing conditions where sequential stimulation is ubiquitous.",

		"abstract": "Discovering the governing laws underpinning physical and chemical phenomena entirely from data is a key step towards understanding and ultimately controlling systems in science and engineering. Noisy measurements and complex, highly nonlinear underlying dynamics hinder the identification of such governing laws. In this work, we introduce a machine learning framework rooted in moving horizon nonlinear optimization for identifying governing equations in the form of ordinary differential equations from noisy experimental data sets. Our approach evaluates sequential subsets of measurement data, and exploits statistical arguments to learn truly parsimonious governing equations from a large dictionary of basis functions. The proposed framework reduces gradient approximation errors by implicitly embedding an advanced numerical discretization scheme, which improves robustness to noise as well as to model stiffness. Canonical nonlinear dynamical system examples are used to demonstrate that our approach can accurately recover parsimonious governing laws under increasing levels of measurement noise, and outperform state of the art frameworks in the literature. Further, we consider a non-isothermal chemical reactor example to demonstrate that the proposed framework can cope with basis functions that have nonlinear (unknown) parameterizations.",

		"abstract": "Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in humans. In recent years, myxoid and proportionated stroma have been described as clinically significant in many cancer subtypes. Here computational portraits of tumor-associated stromata were created from a machine learning (ML) classifier using QuPath to evaluate proportionated stromal area (PSA), myxoid stromal ratio (MSR), and immune stroma proportion (ISP) from whole slide images (WSI). The ML classifier was validated in independent training (n\u2009=\u200940) and validation (n\u2009=\u2009109) cohorts finding MSR, PSA, and ISP to be associated with tumor stage, lymph node status, Nottingham grade, stromal differentiation (SD), tumor size, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 (HER-2). Overall, MSR correlated better with the clinicopathologic profile than PSA and ISP. High MSR was found to be associated with high tumor stage, low ISP, and high Nottingham histologic score. As a computational biomarker, high MSR was more likely to be associated with luminal B like, Her-2 enriched, and triple-negative biomarker status when compared to luminal A like. The supervised ML superpixel approach demonstrated here can be performed by a trained pathologist to provide a faster and more uniformed approach to the analysis to the tumoral microenvironment (TME). The TME may be relevant for clinical decision-making, determining chemotherapeutic efficacy, and guiding a more overall precision-based breast cancer care.",

The effect of glucose metabolism on \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and their impact on tumor surveillance remain unknown. Here, we showed that high glucose induced Warburg effect type of bioenergetic profile in V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells, leading to excessive lactate accumulation, which further inhibited lytic granule secretion by impairing the trafficking of cytolytic machinery to the V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-cell-tumor synapse by suppressing AMPK activation and resulted in the loss of antitumor activity in vitro, in vivo and in patients. Strikingly, activating the AMPK pathway through glucose control or metformin treatment reversed the metabolic abnormalities and restored the antitumor activity of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells. These results suggest that the impaired antitumor activity of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells induced by dysregulated glucose metabolism may contribute to the increased cancer risk in T2DM patients and that metabolic reprogramming by targeting the AMPK pathway with metformin may improve tumor immunosurveillance.",

		"abstract": "Individual differences in behaviour, traits and mental-health are partially heritable. Traditionally, studies have focused on quantifying the heritability of high-order characteristics, such as happiness or education attainment. Here, we quantify the degree of heritability of lower-level mental processes that likely contribute to complex traits and behaviour. In particular, we quantify the degree of heritability of cognitive and affective factors that contribute to the generation of beliefs about risk, which drive behavior in domains ranging from finance to health. Monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs completed a belief formation task. We first show that beliefs about risk are associated with vividness of imagination, affective evaluation and learning abilities. We then demonstrate that the genetic contribution to individual differences in these processes range between 13.5 and 39%, with affect evaluation showing a particular robust heritability component. These results provide clues to which mental factors may be driving the heritability component of beliefs formation, which in turn contribute to the heritability of complex traits.",

		"abstract": "High self-esteem, an overall positive evaluation of self-worth, is a cornerstone of mental health. Previously we showed that people with low self-esteem differentially construct beliefs about momentary self-worth derived from social feedback. However, it remains unknown whether these anomalies extend to constructing beliefs about self-performance in a non-social context, in the absence of external feedback. Here, we examined this question using a novel behavioral paradigm probing subjects' self-performance estimates with or without external feedback. We analyzed data from young adults (N\u2009=\u200957) who were selected from a larger community sample (N\u2009=\u20092402) on the basis of occupying the bottom or top 10% of a reported self-esteem distribution. Participants performed a series of short blocks involving two perceptual decision-making tasks with varying degrees of difficulty, with or without feedback. At the end of each block, they had to decide on which task they thought they performed best, and gave subjective task ratings, providing two measures of self-performance estimates. We found no robust evidence of differences in objective performance between high and low self-esteem participants. Nevertheless, low self-esteem participants consistently underestimated their performance as expressed in lower subjective task ratings relative to high self-esteem participants. These results provide an initial window onto how cognitive processes underpinning the construction of self-performance estimates across different contexts map on to global dispositions relevant to mental health such as self-esteem.",

		"abstract": "The majority (85%) of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (nsCL/P) cases occur sporadically, suggesting a role for de novo mutations (DNMs) in the etiology of nsCL/P. To identify high impact protein-altering DNMs that contribute to the risk of nsCL/P, we conducted whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analyses in 130 African case-parent trios (affected probands and unaffected parents). We identified 162 high confidence protein-altering DNMs some of which are based on available evidence, contribute to the risk of nsCL/P. These include novel protein-truncating DNMs in the ACTL6A, ARHGAP10, MINK1, TMEM5 and TTN genes; as well as missense variants in ACAN, DHRS3, DLX6, EPHB2, FKBP10, KMT2D, RECQL4, SEMA3C, SEMA4D, SHH, TP63, and TULP4. Many of these protein-altering DNMs were predicted to be pathogenic. Analysis using mouse transcriptomics data showed that some of these genes are expressed during the development of primary and secondary palate. Gene-set enrichment analysis of the protein-altering DNMs identified palatal development and neural crest migration among the few processes that were significantly enriched. These processes are directly involved in the etiopathogenesis of clefting. The analysis of the coding sequence in the WGS data provides more evidence of the opportunity for novel findings in the African genome.",

Current artificial intelligence systems pale in their understanding of intuitive physics, in comparison to even very young children. Here we address this gap between humans and machines by drawing on the field of developmental psychology. First, we introduce and open-source a machine-learning dataset designed to evaluate conceptual understanding of intuitive physics, adopting the violation-of-expectation (VoE) paradigm from developmental psychology. Second, we build a deep-learning system that learns intuitive physics directly from visual data, inspired by studies of visual cognition in children. We demonstrate that our model can learn a diverse set of physical concepts, which depends critically on object-level representations, consistent with findings from developmental psychology. We consider the implications of these results both for AI and for research on human cognition.",

		"abstract": "Single-cell Hi-C analysis of diploid human cells is difficult because of the lack of dense chromosome contact information and the presence of homologous chromosomes with very similar nucleotide sequences. Thus here, we propose a new algorithm to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3D) chromosomal architectures from the Hi-C dataset of single diploid human cells using allele-specific single-nucleotide variations (SNVs). We modified our recurrence plot-based algorithm, which is suitable for the estimation of the 3D chromosome structure from sparse Hi-C datasets, by newly incorporating a function of discriminating SNVs specific to each homologous chromosome. Here, we eventually regard a contact map as a recurrence plot. Importantly, the proposed method does not require any imputation for ambiguous segment information, but could efficiently reconstruct 3D chromosomal structures in single human diploid cells at a 1-Mb resolution. Datasets of segments without allele-specific SNVs, which were considered to be of little value, can also be used to validate the estimated chromosome structure. Introducing an additional mathematical measure called a refinement further improved the resolution to 40-kb or 100-kb. The reconstruction data supported the notion that human chromosomes form chromosomal territories and take fractal structures where the dimension for the underlying chromosome structure is a non-integer value.",

		"abstract": "Psychical and functional disturbances of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) patients are drawing increasingly attention, despite the characterized ophthalmic symptoms. We aimed to investigate the alterations of structural complexity using fractal dimension (FD) analysis in patients with TAO. Thirty-nine TAO patients and 25 healthy controls underwent high-resolution 3.0\u00a0T structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). FD values of brain regions were calculated by Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12) and compared between groups. The associations between clinical variables and FD values were further estimated. We found that TAO patients exhibited significantly decreased FD values in right caudal anterior cingulate cortex, right lingual gyrus, right pars orbitalis and right cuneus cortex (FDR corrected p\u2009<\u20090.05). FD values of right cuneus cortex were positively correlated with visual acuity, and FD values of right caudal anterior cingulate cortex were also positively correlated with cognitive performance. Meanwhile, FD values of right lingual gyrus were found to be negatively correlated with emotional function. Our study indicated disturbed cortical complexity in brain regions corresponding to known functional deficits of vision, emotion and cognition in TAO. FD might be a potential marker for reflecting the underlying neurobiological basis of TAO.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAdvancements in metagenomics sequencing allow the study of microbial communities directly from their environments. Metagenomics binning is a key step in the species characterisation of microbial communities. Next-generation sequencing reads are usually assembled into contigs for metagenomics binning mainly due to the limited information within short reads. Third-generation sequencing provides much longer reads that have lengths similar to the contigs assembled from short reads. However, existing contig-binning tools cannot be directly applied on long reads due to the absence of coverage information and the presence of high error rates. The few existing long-read binning tools either use only composition or use composition and coverage information separately. This may ignore bins that correspond to low-abundance species or erroneously split bins that correspond to species with non-uniform coverages. Here we present a reference-free binning approach, LRBinner, that combines composition and coverage information of complete long-read datasets. LRBinner also uses a distance-histogram-based clustering algorithm to extract clusters with varying sizes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe experimental results on both simulated and real datasets show that LRBinner achieves the best binning accuracy in most cases while handling the complete datasets without any sampling. Moreover, we show that binning reads using LRBinner prior to assembly reduces computational resources required for assembly while attaining satisfactory assembly qualities.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nLRBinner shows that deep-learning techniques can be used for effective feature aggregation to support the metagenomics binning of long reads. Furthermore, accurate binning of long reads supports improvements in metagenomics assembly, especially in complex datasets. Binning also helps to reduce the resources required for assembly.

		"abstract": "Heterogeneous biomedical pharmacological databases are important for multiple fields in bioinformatics. Hetionet is a freely available database combining diverse entities and relationships from 29 public resources. Therefore, it is used as the basis for this project. 19 additional pharmacological medical and biological databases such as CTD, DrugBank, and ClinVar are parsed and integrated into Neo4j. Afterwards, the information is merged into the Hetionet structure. Different mapping methods are used such as external identification systems or name mapping. The resulting open-source Neo4j database PharMeBINet has 2,869,407 different nodes with 66 labels and 15,883,653 relationships with 208 edge types. It is a heterogeneous database containing interconnected information on ADRs, diseases, drugs, genes, gene variations, proteins, and more. Relationships between these entities represent drug-drug interactions or drug-causes-ADR relations, to name a few. It has much potential for developing further data analyses including machine learning applications. A web application for accessing the database is free to use for everyone and available at https://pharmebi.net . Additionally, the database is deposited on Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6578218 .",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND\nVarious mammalian species emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), which reflect their emotional state and mediate social interactions. USVs are usually analyzed by manual or semi-automated methodologies that categorize discrete USVs according to their structure in the frequency-time domains. This laborious analysis hinders the effective use of USVs as a readout for high-throughput analysis of behavioral changes in animals.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHere we present a novel automated open-source tool that utilizes a different approach towards USV analysis, termed TrackUSF. To validate TrackUSF, we analyzed calls from different animal species, namely mice, rats, and bats, recorded in various settings and compared the results with a manual analysis by a trained observer. We found that TrackUSF detected the majority of USVs, with less than 1% of false-positive detections. We then employed TrackUSF to analyze social vocalizations in Shank3-deficient rats, a rat model of autism, and revealed that these vocalizations exhibit a spectrum of deviations from appetitive calls towards aversive calls.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTrackUSF is a simple and easy-to-use system that may be used for a high-throughput comparison of ultrasonic vocalizations between groups of animals of any kind in any setting, with no prior assumptions.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND\nUnderstanding the regulatory role of enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs) on specific gene expression in cells contributes to the understanding of gene regulation, cell differentiation, etc., and its identification has been a challenging task. On the one hand, using traditional wet experimental methods to identify EPIs often means a lot of human labor and time costs. On the other hand, although the currently proposed computational methods have good recognition effects, they generally require a long training time.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn this study, we studied the EPIs of six human cell lines and designed a cell line-specific EPIs prediction method based on a stacking ensemble learning strategy, which has better prediction performance and faster training speed, called StackEPI. Specifically, by combining different encoding schemes and machine learning methods, our prediction method can extract the cell line-specific effective information of enhancer and promoter gene sequences comprehensively and in many directions, and make accurate recognition of cell line-specific EPIs. Ultimately, the source code to implement StackEPI and experimental data involved in the experiment are available at https://github.com/20032303092/StackEPI.git .\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe comparison results show that our model can deliver better performance on the problem of identifying cell line-specific EPIs and outperform other state-of-the-art models. In addition, our model also has a more efficient computation speed.",

		"abstract": "Spiking neural membrane systems are models of computation inspired by the natural functioning of the brain using the concepts of neurons and synapses, and represent a way of building computational systems of a biological inspiration. A variant of such a model, allowing to create new neurons and synapses during the computation, has been considered in the literature to attack computationally hard problems, like problems in the class NP. In this work, we investigate the computational properties of this variant, by proposing three solutions to computationally hard problems, by models with different features, and comparing them with those present in the literature. In particular, we first propose a nondeterministic solution for the NP-complete problem 3-SAT, by a model using dynamic organization of synapses. Then, we propose a deterministic solution for the same problem, by a model using neuron division and dissolution rules. Finally, we show that dissolution rules are not strictly necessary (by accepting a certain amount of slowdown in computing time), and that also problems beyond the class NP can be solved by systems with neuron division alone.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMircoRNAs (miRNAs) play a central role in diverse biological processes of Camellia sinensis var.assamica (CSA) through their associations with target mRNAs, including CSA growth, development and stress response. However, although the experiment methods of CSA miRNA-target identifications are costly and time-consuming, few computational methods have been developed to tackle the CSA miRNA-target association prediction problem.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn this paper, we constructed a heterogeneous network for CSA miRNA and targets by integrating rich biological information, including a miRNA similarity network, a target similarity network, and a miRNA-target association network. We then proposed a deep learning framework of graph convolution networks with layer attention mechanism, named MTAGCN. In particular, MTAGCN uses the attention mechanism to combine embeddings of multiple graph convolution layers, employing the integrated embedding to score the unobserved CSA miRNA-target associations.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nComprehensive experiment results on two tasks (balanced task and unbalanced task) demonstrated that our proposed model achieved better performance than the classic machine learning and existing graph convolution network-based methods. The analysis of these results could offer valuable information for understanding complex CSA miRNA-target association mechanisms and would make a contribution to precision plant breeding.",

		"abstract": "AIMS\nIn colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, a promising marker is tumor-stroma ratio (TSR). Quantification issues highlight the importance of precise assessment that might be solved by artificial intelligence (AI)-based digital image analysis systems. Some alternatives have been offered so far, although these platforms are either proprietary developments or require additional programming skills. Our aim was to validate a user-friendly, commercially available software running in everyday computational environment to improve TSR assessment and also to compare the prognostic value of assessing TSR in three distinct regions of interests (ROIs), like hotspot, invasive front and whole tumor. Furthermore, we compared the prognostic power of TSR with newly suggested carcinoma percentage (CP) and carcinoma-stroma percentage (CSP).\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nSlides of 185 stage I-IV CRC patients with clinical follow up data were scanned and evaluated by a senior pathologist. A machine learning-based digital pathology software was trained to recognize tumoral and stromal compartments. The aforementioned parameters were evaluated in the hotspot, invasive front and whole tumor area, both visually and by machine learning. Patients were classified based on TSR, CP and CSP values. On multivariate analysis, TSR-hotspot was found to be an independent prognostic factor of overall survival (hazard ratio for TSR-hotspotsoftware: 2.005 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.146-3.507), p=0.011, for TSR-hostpotvisual: 1.781 (CI: 1.060-2.992) p=0.029). Also, TSR was an independent predictor for distant metastasis and local relapse in most settings. Generally, software performance was comparable to visual evaluation and delivered reliable prognostication in more settings also with CP and CSP values.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study presents that software assisted evaluation is a robust prognosticator. Our approach used a less sophisticated and thus easily accessible software without the aid of convolutional neural network; however, it was still effective enough to deliver reliable prognostic information.",

		"abstract": "One of the most unique and impressive feats of the human mind is its ability to discover and continuously refine its own cognitive strategies. Elucidating the underlying learning and adaptation mechanisms is very difficult because changes in cognitive strategies are not directly observable. One important domain in which strategies and mechanisms are studied is planning. To enable researchers to uncover how people learn how to plan, we offer a tutorial introduction to a recently developed process-tracing paradigm along with a new computational method for measuring the nature and development of a person's planning strategies from the resulting process-tracing data. Our method allows researchers to reveal experience-driven changes in people's choice of individual planning operations, planning strategies, strategy types, and the relative contributions of different decision systems. We validate our method on simulated and empirical data. On simulated data, its inferences about the strategies and the relative influence of different decision systems are accurate. When evaluated on human data generated using our process-tracing paradigm, our computational method correctly detects the plasticity-enhancing effect of feedback and the effect of the structure of the environment on people's planning strategies. Together, these methods can be used to investigate the mechanisms of cognitive plasticity and to elucidate how people acquire complex cognitive skills such as planning and problem-solving. Importantly, our methods can also be used to measure individual differences in cognitive plasticity and examine how different types (pedagogical) interventions affect the acquisition of cognitive skills.",

		"abstract": "Prion protein (PrP) aggregation and formation of PrP amyloid (APrP) are central events in the pathogenesis of prion diseases. In the dominantly inherited prion protein amyloidosis known as Gerstmann-Str\u00e4ussler-Scheinker (GSS) disease, plaques made of PrP amyloid are present throughout the brain. The c.593t\u2009>\u2009c mutation in the prion protein gene (PRNP) results in a phenylalanine to serine amino acid substitution at PrP residue 198 (F198S) and causes the most severe amyloidosis among GSS variants. It has been shown that neurodegeneration in this disease is associated with the presence of extracellular APrP plaques and neuronal intracytoplasmic Tau inclusions, that have been shown to contain paired helical filaments identical to those found in Alzheimer disease. Using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we determined for the first time the structures of filaments of human APrP, isolated post-mortem from the brain of two symptomatic PRNP F198S mutation carriers. We report that in GSS (F198S) APrP filaments are composed of dimeric, trimeric and tetrameric left-handed protofilaments with their protomers sharing a common protein fold. The protomers in the cross-\u03b2 spines consist of 62 amino acids and span from glycine 80 to phenylalanine 141, adopting a previously unseen spiral fold with a thicker outer layer and a thinner inner layer. Each protomer comprises nine short \u03b2-strands, with the \u03b21 and \u03b28 strands, as well as the \u03b24 and \u03b29 strands, forming a steric zipper. The data obtained by cryo-EM provide insights into the structural complexity of the PrP filament in a dominantly inherited human PrP amyloidosis. The novel findings highlight the urgency of extending our knowledge of the filaments' structures that may underlie distinct clinical and pathologic phenotypes of human neurodegenerative diseases.",

To probe the relationship between calcium dynamics and spine morphology, we used a stochastic reaction-diffusion model of calcium dynamics in idealized and realistic geometries. We show that despite the stochastic nature of the various calcium channels, receptors, and pumps, spine size and shape can modulate calcium dynamics and subsequently synaptic weight updates in a deterministic manner. Through a series of exhaustive simulations and analyses, we found that the calcium dynamics and synaptic weight change depend on the volume-to-surface area of the spine. The relationships between calcium dynamics and spine morphology identified in idealized geometries also hold in realistic geometries, suggesting that there are geometrically determined deterministic relationships that may modulate synaptic weight change.",

		"abstract": "Purpose\nTo explore relationships between patterns of fetal anthropometric growth, as reflective of fetal wellbeing, and global retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measured in young adulthood.\n\n\nMethods\nParticipants (n = 481) from within a Western Australian pregnancy cohort study underwent five serial ultrasound scans during gestation, with fetal biometry measured at each scan. Optic disc parameters were measured via spectral-domain optical coherence tomography imaging at a 20-year follow-up eye examination. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate differences in global RNFL thickness between groups of participants who had undergone similar growth trajectories based on fetal head circumference (FHC), abdominal circumference (FAC), femur length (FFL), and estimated fetal weight (EFW).\n\n\nResults\nParticipants with consistently large FHCs throughout gestation had significantly thicker global RNFLs than those with any other pattern of FHC growth (P = 0.023), even after adjustment for potential confounders (P = 0.037). Based on model fit statistics, FHC growth trajectory was a better predictor of global RNFL thickness than birth weight or head circumference at birth. RNFL thickness did not vary significantly between groups of participants with different growth trajectories based on FAC, FFL, or EFW.\n\n\nConclusions\nFHC growth is associated with RNFL thickness in young adulthood and, moreover, is a better predictor than either birth weight or head circumference at birth.\n\n\nTranslational Relevance\nThis research demonstrates an association between intrauterine growth and long-term optic nerve health, providing a basis for further exploring the extent of the influence of fetal wellbeing on clinical conditions linked to RNFL thinning.",

In this work, the recently developed machine learning-assisted lipid phase analysis technique for learning the phase of individual lipids has been combined with generalized Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics to reduce the overall computational expense of evaluating transition temperatures.

COVID-19 is a highly contagious virus, and some patients may experience acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute respiratory failure leading to death. We aim to evaluate the clinical, imaging, and laboratory parameters according to survival time to predict mortality in fatal COVID-19 patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFatal 350 and survived 150 COVID-19 patients were included in the study. Fatal patients were divided into three groups according to the median value of the survival days.

		"abstract": "Introduction\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of nasomaxillary expansion using skeletally anchored transpalatal distraction (TPD) in children without transverse maxillary deficiency that were previously treated by rapid palatal expansion (RPE).\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nTwenty-nine consecutive children were treated by TPD. Twenty-five children, aged 10-16 years completed pre- and post-operative clinical evaluations, questionnaires (OSA-18), cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), and polysomnography (PSG). The pre- and post-operative CBCT data were used to reconstruct the 3-dimensional shape of the upper airway. Two measures of airflow function (pressure and velocity) were simulated by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) at four different airway segments (nasal, nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal).\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-three patients (92%) experienced improvement based on PSG. The apnea hypopnea index (AHI) improved from 6.72 \u00b1 4.34 to 3.59 \u00b1 5.11 (p<0.001) events per hour. Clinical symptoms based on OSA-18 scores were improved in all patients. Twenty-five patients (100%) had successful expansion defined as separation of the midpalatal suture at least 1mm from anterior nasal spine (ANS) to posterior nasal spine (PNS). The nasal sidewall widening was 2.59 \u00b1 1,54 mm at canine, 2.91 \u00b1 1,23 mm at first molar and 2.30 \u00b1 1,29 mm at PNS. The ratio of dental expansion to nasal expansion was 1.12:1 (2.90mm:2.59mm) at canine and 1.37:1 (3.98mm:2.91mm) at first molar. The nasal airflow pressure reduced by 76% (-275.73 to -67.28 Pa) and the nasal airflow velocity reduced by over 50% (18.60 to 8.56 m/s).\n\n\nConclusions\nNasomaxillary expansion by skeletally anchored TPD improves OSA in children without transverse maxillary deficiency that were previously treated by RPE. A nearly parallel anterior-posterior opening of the mid-palatal suture achieves enlargement of the entire nasal passage with improvement of the airflow characteristics in the nasal and pharyngeal airway. The improved airflow characteristic is significantly correlated with the improved polysomnographic findings, thus demonstrating that nasomaxillary expansion in previously expanded patients is a viable treatment option.",

		"abstract": "Metabolism is the process by which an organism continuously replaces old substances with new substances. It plays an important role in maintaining human life, body growth and reproduction. More and more researchers have shown that the concentrations of some metabolites in patients are different from those in healthy people. Traditional biological experiments can test some hypotheses and verify their relationships but usually take a considerable amount of time and money. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a new computational method to identify the relationships between metabolites and diseases. In this work, we present a new deep learning algorithm named as graph convolutional network with graph attention network (GCNAT) to predict the potential associations of disease-related metabolites. First, we construct a heterogeneous network based on known metabolite-disease associations, metabolite-metabolite similarities and disease-disease similarities. Metabolite and disease features are encoded and learned through the graph convolutional neural network. Then, a graph attention layer is used to combine the embeddings of multiple convolutional layers, and the corresponding attention coefficients are calculated to assign different weights to the embeddings of each layer. Further, the prediction result is obtained by decoding and scoring the final synthetic embeddings. Finally, GCNAT achieves a reliable area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 and the precision-recall curve of 0.405, which are better than the results of existing five state-of-the-art predictive methods in 5-fold cross-validation, and the case studies show that the metabolite-disease correlations predicted by our method can be successfully demonstrated by relevant experiments. We hope that GCNAT could be a useful biomedical research tool for predicting potential metabolite-disease associations in the future.",

		"abstract": "Over the past few decades, data-driven machine learning (ML) has distinguished itself from hypothesis-driven studies and has recently received much attention in environmental toxicology. However, the use of ML in environmental toxicology remains in the early stages, with knowledge gaps, technical bottlenecks in data quality, high-dimensional/heterogeneous/small-sample data analysis and model interpretability, and a lack of an in-depth understanding of environmental toxicology. Given the above problems, we review the recent progress in the literature and highlight state-of-the-art toxicological studies using ML (such as learning and predicting toxicity in complicated biosystems and multiple-factor environmental scenarios of long-term and large-scale pollution). Beyond predicting simple biological endpoints by integrating untargeted omics and adverse outcome pathways, ML development should focus on revealing toxicological mechanisms. The integration of data-driven ML with other methods (e.g., omics analysis and adverse outcome pathway frameworks) endows ML with widely promising application in revealing toxicological mechanisms. High-quality databases and interpretable algorithms are urgently needed for toxicology and environmental science. Addressing the core issues and future challenges for ML in this review may narrow the knowledge gap between environmental toxicity and computational science and facilitate the control of environmental risk in the future.",

These areas often involve fleetingly existent intermediates whose thermochemistry is difficult to assess. Whenever direct calorimetric experiments are infeasible, accurate computational estimates of relative molecular energies are required. However, high-level computations, often using coupled cluster theory, are generally resource-intensive. To expedite the process using machine learning techniques, we generated a database of energies for small organic molecules at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVDZ, CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ, and CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ levels of theory. Leveraging the power of deep learning by employing graph neural networks, we are able to predict the effect of perturbatively included triples (T), that is, the difference between CCSD and CCSD(T) energies, with a mean absolute error of 0.25, 0.25, and 0.28 kcal mol-1 (R2 of 0.998, 0.997, and 0.998) with the cc-pVDZ, aug-cc-pVDZ, and cc-pVTZ basis sets, respectively.

The current lack of interpretability often undermines the deployment of accurate machine learning tools in sensitive settings. In this work, we present a model-agnostic explanation method for image classification based on a hierarchical extension of Shapley coefficients-Hierarchical Shap (h-Shap)-that resolves some of the limitations of current approaches. Unlike other Shapley-based explanation methods, h-Shap is scalable and can be computed without the need of approximation. Under certain distributional assumptions, such as those common in multiple instance learning, h-Shap retrieves the exact Shapley coefficients with an exponential improvement in computational complexity. We compare our hierarchical approach with popular Shapley-based and non-Shapley-based methods on a synthetic dataset, a medical imaging scenario, and a general computer vision problem, showing that h-Shap outperforms the state of the art in both accuracy and runtime.

		"abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) strictly regulates the exchange of ions and molecules between the blood and the central nervous system. Tight junctions (TJs) are multimeric structures that control the transport through the paracellular spaces between the adjacent brain endothelial cells of the BBB. Claudin-5 (Cldn5) proteins are essential for TJ formation and assemble into multiprotein complexes via cis-interactions within the same cell membrane and trans-interactions across two contiguous cells. Despite the relevant biological function of Cldn5 proteins and their role as targets of brain drug delivery strategies, the molecular details of their assembly within TJs are still unclear. Two different structural models have been recently introduced, in which Cldn5 dimers belonging to opposite cells join to generate paracellular pores. However, a comparison of these models in terms of ionic transport features is still lacking. In this work, we used molecular dynamics simulations and free energy (FE) calculations to assess the two Cldn5 pore models and investigate the thermodynamic properties of water and physiological ions permeating through them. Despite different FE profiles, both structures present single/multiple FE barriers to ionic permeation, while being permissive to water flux. These results reveal that both models are compatible with the physiological role of Cldn5 TJ strands. By identifying the protein-protein surface at the core of TJ Cldn5 assemblies, our computational investigation provides a basis for the rational design of synthetic peptides and other molecules capable of opening paracellular pores in the BBB.",

		"abstract": "Fibromyalgia (FM) is an unsolved central pain processing disturbance. We aim to provide a unifying model for FM pathogenesis based on a loop network involving thalamocortical regions, i.e., the ventroposterior lateral thalamus (VPL), the somatosensory cortex (SC), and the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). The dynamics of the loop have been described by three differential equations having neuron mean firing rates as variables and containing Hill functions to model mutual interactions among the loop elements. A computational analysis conducted with MATLAB has shown a transition from monostability to bistability of the loop behavior for a weakening of GABAergic transmission between TRN and VPL. This involves the appearance of a high-firing-rate steady state, which becomes dominant and is assumed to represent pathogenic pain processing giving rise to chronic pain. Our model is consistent with a bulk of literature evidence, such as neuroimaging and pharmacological data collected on FM patients, and with correlations between FM and immunoendocrine conditions, such as stress, perimenopause, chronic inflammation, obesity, and chronic dizziness. The model suggests that critical targets for FM treatment are to be found among immunoendocrine pathways leading to GABA/glutamate imbalance having an impact on the thalamocortical system.",

		"abstract": "The potential energy surface (PES) is crucial for interpreting a variety of chemical reaction processes. However, predicting accurate PESs with high-level electronic structure methods is a challenging task due to the high computational cost. As an appealing application of quantum computing, we show in this work that variational quantum algorithms can be integrated with machine learning (ML) techniques as a promising scheme for exploring accurate PESs. Different from using a ML model to represent the potential energy, we encode the molecular geometry information into a deep neural network (DNN) to represent parameters of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), leaving the PES to the wave function ansatz. Once the DNN model is trained, the variational optimization procedure that hinders the application of the VQE to complex systems is avoided, and thus the evaluation of PESs is significantly accelerated. Numerical results demonstrate that a simple DNN model is able to reproduce accurate PESs for small molecules.",

		"abstract": "Psychophysical, motor control, and modeling studies have revealed that sensorimotor reference frame transformations (RFTs) add variability to transformed signals. For perceptual decision-making, this phenomenon could decrease the fidelity of a decision signal's representation or alternatively improve its processing through stochastic facilitation. We investigated these two hypotheses under various sensorimotor RFT constraints. Participants performed a time-limited, forced-choice motion discrimination task under eight combinations of head roll and/or stimulus rotation while responding either with a saccade or button press. This paradigm, together with the use of a decision model, allowed us to parameterize and correlate perceptual decision behavior with eye-, head-, and shoulder-centered sensory and motor reference frames. Misalignments between sensory and motor reference frames produced systematic changes in reaction time and response accuracy. For some conditions, these changes were consistent with a degradation of motion evidence commensurate with a decrease in stimulus strength in our model framework. Differences in participant performance were explained by a continuum of eye-head-shoulder representations of accumulated motion evidence, with an eye-centered bias during saccades and a shoulder-centered bias during button presses. In addition, we observed evidence for stochastic facilitation during head-rolled conditions (i.e., head roll resulted in faster, more accurate decisions in oblique motion for a given stimulus-response misalignment). We show that perceptual decision-making and stochastic RFTs are inseparable within the present context. We show that by simply rolling one's head, perceptual decision-making is altered in a way that is predicted by stochastic RFTs.",

		"abstract": "The convergence of advanced single-cell in vivo functional imaging techniques, computational modeling tools, and graph-based network analytics has heralded new opportunities to study single-cell dynamics across large-scale networks, providing novel insights into principles of brain communication and pointing towards potential new strategies for treating neurological disorders. A major recent finding has been the identification of unusually richly connected hub cells that have capacity to synchronize networks and may be also critical in network dysfunction. While hub neurons are traditionally defined by measures that consider solely the number and strength of connections, novel higher-order graph analytics now enables the mining of massive networks for repeating subgraph patterns called motifs. As an illustration of the power offered by higher order analysis of neuronal networks, we highlight how recent methodological advances uncovered a new functional cell type, the superhub, that is predicted to play a major role in regulating network dynamics. Finally, we discuss open questions that will be critical for assessing the importance of higher order cellular-scale network analytics in understanding brain function in health and disease.

To detect behavior change, digital behavior markers (DM) are extracted from smartwatch sensor data and a Permutation-based Change Detection (PCD) algorithm quantifies the change in marker-based behavior from a pre-intervention, one-week baseline. To validate the method, we verify that changes are successfully detected from synthetic data with known pattern differences. Next, we employ this method to detect overall behavior change for n=28 BHI subjects and n=17 age-matched control subjects. For these individuals, we observe a monotonic increase in behavior change from the baseline week with a slope of 0.7460 for the intervention group and a slope of 0.0230 for the control group. Finally, we utilize a random forest algorithm to perform leave-one-subject-out prediction of intervention versus control subjects based on digital marker delta values. The random forest predicts whether the subject is in the intervention or control group with an accuracy of 0.87. This work has implications for capturing objective, continuous data to inform our understanding of intervention adoption and impact.",

However, the development of brain-computer interfaces has been limited by several factors that affect their performance, such as the characterization of events in brain signals and the excessive processing load generated by the high volume of data. In this paper, we propose a method based on computational intelligence techniques to handle these problems, turning them into a single optimization problem. An artificial neural network is used as a classifier for event detection, along with an evolutionary algorithm to find the optimal subset of electrodes and data points that better represents the target event.

		"abstract": "Oral cancer is one of the lethal diseases among the available malignant tumors globally, and it has become a challenging health issue in developing and low-to-middle income countries. The prognosis of oral cancer remains poor because over 50% of patients are recognized at advanced stages. Earlier detection and screening models for oral cancer are mainly based on experts' knowledge, and it necessitates an automated tool for oral cancer detection. The recent developments of computational intelligence (CI) and computer vision-based approaches help to accomplish enhanced performance in medical-image-related tasks. This article develops an intelligent deep learning enabled oral squamous cell carcinoma detection and classification (IDL-OSCDC) technique using biomedical images. The presented IDL-OSCDC model involves the recognition and classification of oral cancer on biomedical images. The proposed IDL-OSCDC model employs Gabor filtering (GF) as a preprocessing step to eliminate noise content. In addition, the NasNet model is exploited for the generation of high-level deep features from the input images. Moreover, an enhanced grasshopper optimization algorithm (EGOA)-based deep belief network (DBN) model is employed for oral cancer detection and classification. The hyperparameter tuning of the DBN model is performed using the EGOA algorithm which in turn boosts the classification outcomes. The experimentation outcomes of the IDL-OSCDC model using a benchmark biomedical imaging dataset highlighted its promising performance over the other methods with maximum accu  , prec  , reca  , and F score of 95%, 96.15%, 93.75%, and 94.67% correspondingly.",

Therefore, how to use an efficient classifier to make a speech recognition system with a high recognition rate is one of the current research focuses. Based on the idea of machine learning, this study combines the computational random forest classification method to improve the algorithm and builds an English speech recognition model based on machine learning. Moreover, this study uses a lightweight model and its improved model to recognize speech signals and directly performs adaptive wavelet threshold shrinkage and denoising on the generated time-frequency images. In addition, this study uses the EI strong classifier to replace the softmax of the lightweight AlexNet model, which further improves the recognition accuracy under a low signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, this study designs experiments to verify the model effect. The research results show that the effect of the model constructed in this study is good.",

However, when graphs vary over time, repeated sparsification requires polynomial order computational cost per update. We propose a new type of graph sparsification namely fault-tolerant (FT) sparsification to significantly reduce the cost to only a constant. Then the computational cost of subsequent graph learning tasks can be significantly improved with limited loss in their accuracy. In particular, we give theoretical analysis to upper bound the loss in the accuracy of the subsequent Laplacian-regularized estimation, graph SSL and SC, due to the FT sparsification. In addition, FT spectral sparsification can be generalized to FT cut sparsification, for cut-based graph learning. Extensive experiments have confirmed the computational efficiencies and accuracies of the proposed methods for learning on dynamic graphs.",

		"abstract": "Recombination contributes to the genetic diversity found in coronaviruses and is known to be a prominent mechanism whereby they evolve. It is apparent, both from controlled experiments and in genome sequences sampled from nature, that patterns of recombination in coronaviruses are non-random and that this is likely attributable to a combination of sequence features that favour the occurrence of recombination break points at specific genomic sites, and selection disfavouring the survival of recombinants within which favourable intra-genome interactions have been disrupted. Here we leverage available whole-genome sequence data for six coronavirus subgenera to identify specific patterns of recombination that are conserved between multiple subgenera and then identify the likely factors that underlie these conserved patterns. Specifically, we confirm the non-randomness of recombination break points across all six tested coronavirus subgenera, locate conserved recombination hot- and cold-spots, and determine that the locations of transcriptional regulatory sequences are likely major determinants of conserved recombination break-point hotspot locations. We find that while the locations of recombination break points are not uniformly associated with degrees of nucleotide sequence conservation, they display significant tendencies in multiple coronavirus subgenera to occur in low guanine-cytosine content genome regions, in non-coding regions, at the edges of genes, and at sites within the Spike gene that are predicted to be minimally disruptive of Spike protein folding. While it is apparent that sequence features such as transcriptional regulatory sequences are likely major determinants of where the template-switching events that yield recombination break points most commonly occur, it is evident that selection against misfolded recombinant proteins also strongly impacts observable recombination break-point distributions in coronavirus genomes sampled from nature.",

		"abstract": "Background\nLateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) are being used worldwide for COVID-19 mass testing and antibody prevalence studies. Relatively simple to use and low cost, these tests can be self-administered at home, but rely on subjective interpretation of a test line by eye, risking false positives and false negatives. Here, we report on the development of ALFA (Automated Lateral Flow Analysis) to improve reported sensitivity and specificity.\n\n\nMethods\nOur computational pipeline uses machine learning, computer vision techniques and signal processing algorithms to analyse images of the Fortress LFIA SARS-CoV-2 antibody self-test, and subsequently classify results as invalid, IgG negative and IgG positive. A large image library of 595,339 participant-submitted test photographs was created as part of the REACT-2 community SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence study in England, UK. Alongside ALFA, we developed an analysis toolkit which could also detect device blood leakage issues.\n\n\nResults\nAutomated analysis showed substantial agreement with human experts (Cohen's kappa 0.90-0.97) and performed consistently better than study participants, particularly for weak positive IgG results. Specificity (98.7-99.4%) and sensitivity (90.1-97.1%) were high compared with visual interpretation by human experts (ranges due to the varying prevalence of weak positive IgG tests in datasets).\n\n\nConclusions\nGiven the potential for LFIAs to be used at scale in the COVID-19 response (for both antibody and antigen testing), even a small improvement in the accuracy of the algorithms could impact the lives of millions of people by reducing the risk of false-positive and false-negative result read-outs by members of the public. Our findings support the use of machine learning-enabled automated reading of at-home antibody lateral flow tests as a tool for improved accuracy for population-level community surveillance.",

		"abstract": "Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines have been developed to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. These vaccines have been effective in reducing the rate and severity of COVID-19 infection but also have been associated with various adverse events (AEs). In this study, data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) was queried and analyzed via the Cov19VaxKB vaccine safety statistical analysis tool to identify statistically significant (i.e., enriched) AEs for the three currently FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccines. An ontology-based classification and literature review were conducted for these enriched AEs. Using VAERS data as of 31 December 2021, 96 AEs were found to be statistically significantly associated with the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and/or Janssen COVID-19 vaccines. The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine had a higher crude reporting rate of AEs compared to the Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines. Females appeared to have a higher case report frequency for top adverse events compared to males. Using the Ontology of Adverse Event (OAE), these 96 adverse events were classified to different categories such as behavioral and neurological AEs, cardiovascular AEs, female reproductive system AEs, and immune system AEs. Further statistical comparison between different ages, doses, and sexes was also performed for three notable AEs: myocarditis, GBS, and thrombosis. The Pfizer vaccine was found to have a closer association with myocarditis than the other two COVID-19 vaccines in VAERS, while the Janssen vaccine was more likely to be associated with thrombosis and GBS AEs. To support standard AE representation and study, we have also modeled and classified the newly identified thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) AE and its subclasses in the OAE by incorporating the Brighton Collaboration definition. Notably, severe COVID-19 vaccine AEs (including myocarditis, GBS, and TTS) rarely occur in comparison to the large number of COVID-19 vaccinations administered in the United States, affirming the overall safety of these COVID-19 vaccines.",

		"abstract": "Background\nType-Token Ratio (TTR), given its relatively simple hand computation, is one of the few LSA measures calculated by clinicians in everyday practice. However, it has significant well-documented shortcomings; these include instability as a function of sample size, and absence of clear developmental profiles over early childhood. A variety of alternative measures of lexical diversity have been proposed; some, such as Number of Different Words/100 (NDW) can also be computed by hand. However, others, such as Vocabulary Diversity (VocD) and the Moving Average Type Token Ratio (MATTR) rely on complex resampling algorithms that cannot be conducted by hand. To date, no large-scale study of all four measures has evaluated how well any capture typical developmental trends over early childhood, or whether any reliably distinguish typical from atypical profiles of expressive child language ability.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nWe conducted linear and non-linear regression analyses for TTR, NDW, VocD, and MATTR scores for samples taken from 946 corpora from typically developing preschool children (ages 2-6 years), engaged in adult-child toy play, from the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES). These were contrasted with 504 samples from children known to have delayed expressive language skills (total n = 1,454 samples). We also conducted a separate sub-analysis which examined possible contextual effects of sampling environment on lexical diversity.\n\n\nResults\nOnly VocD showed significantly different mean scores between the typically -developing children and delayed developing children group. Using TTR would actually misdiagnose typical children and miss children with known language impairment. However, computation of VocD as a function of toy interactions was significant and emerges as a further caution in use of lexical diversity as a valid proxy index of children's expressive vocabulary skill.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis large scale statistical comparison of computer-implemented algorithms for expressive lexical profiles in young children with traditional, hand-calculated measures showed that only VocD met criteria for evidence-based use in LSA. However, VocD was impacted by sample elicitation context, suggesting that non-linguistic factors, such as engagement with elicitation props, contaminate estimates of spoken lexical skill in young children. Implications and suggested directions are discussed.",

		"abstract": "Background\nPer- and poly-fluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are environment-persitent emerging endocrine disrupting chemicals raising health concerns worldwide. Exposure to PFAS has been associated with the imbalance of thyroid hormones. However, available studies addressing the cell mechanism underlying thyroid disrupting feature of legacy PFAS, such as perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA), perfluoro-octane-sulfonic acid (PFOS), and the new generation substitutes, such as C6O4, are still lacking. In this study the potential disrupting effect of PFOA, PFOS, and C6O4 on a murine thyroid cell model was assessed.\n\n\nMethods\nA rat FRTL-5 cell line was used as the normal thyroid follicular cell model. Cell iodide-uptake, induced by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), was used to assess the functional impact of PFAS exposure on cell function. Tetrazolium salt-based cell viability assay and merocyanine 540-based cell staining were used to address the possible involvement of cell toxicity and membrane biophysical properties on altered cell function. The possible direct interaction of PFAS with TSH-receptor (TSH-R) was investigated by computer-based molecular docking and analysis of molecular dynamics. Evaluation of intracellular cAMP levels and gene expression analysis were used to validate the direct impairment of TSH-R-mediated downstream events upon PFAS exposure.\n\n\nResults\nDifferent from PFOS or C6O4, exposure to PFOA at a concentration \u2265 10 ng/mL was associated with significant impairment of the iodide uptake upon TSH stimulation (respectively: basal 100.0 \u00b1 19.0%, CTRL + TSH 188.9 \u00b1 7.8%, PFOA 10 ng/mL + TSH 120.4 \u00b1 20.9%, p= 0.030 vs CTRL + TSH; PFOA 100 ng/mL + TSH 115,6 \u00b1 12,3% p= 0.017 vs CTRL + TSH). No impairment of cell viability or membrane stability was observed. Computational analysis showed a possible direct differential interaction of C6O4, PFOA, and PFOS on a same binding site of the extracellular domain of TSH-R. Finally, exposure to PFOA was associated with a significant reduction of downstream intracellular cAMP levels and both sodium-iodide transporter and thyroperoxidase gene expression upon TSH-R stimulation.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur data suggest that legacy and new generation PFAS can differentially influence TSH dependent signaling pathways through the direct interaction with TSH-R.",

		"abstract": "Brain cancer is a rare and deadly disease with a slim chance of survival. One of the most important tasks for neurologists and radiologists is to detect brain tumors early. Recent claims have been made that computer-aided diagnosis-based systems can diagnose brain tumors by employing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a supporting technology. We propose transfer learning approaches for a deep learning model to detect malignant tumors, such as glioblastoma, using MRI scans in this study. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for brain tumor identification and classification using the state-of-the-art object detection framework YOLO (You Only Look Once). The YOLOv5 is a novel object detection deep learning technique that requires limited computational architecture than its competing models. The study used the Brats 2021 dataset from the RSNA-MICCAI brain tumor radio genomic classification. The dataset has images annotated from RSNA-MICCAI brain tumor radio genomic competition dataset using the make sense an AI online tool for labeling dataset. The preprocessed data is then divided into testing and training for the model. The YOLOv5 model provides a precision of 88 percent. Finally, our model is tested across the whole dataset, and it is concluded that it is able to detect brain tumors successfully.",

		"abstract": "Modern technologies designed for tissue structure visualization like brightfield microscopy, fluorescent microscopy, mass cytometry imaging (MCI) and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) provide large amounts of quantitative and spatial information about cells and tissue structures like vessels, bronchioles etc. Many published reports have demonstrated that the structural features of cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) and their interactions strongly predict disease development and progression. Computational image analysis methods in combination with spatial analysis and machine learning can reveal novel structural patterns in normal and diseased tissue. Here, we have developed a Python package designed for integrated analysis of cells and ECM in a spatially dependent manner. The package performs segmentation, labeling and feature analysis of ECM fibers, combines this information with pre-generated single-cell based datasets and realizes cell-cell and cell-fiber spatial analysis. To demonstrate performance and compatibility of our computational tool, we integrated it with a pipeline designed for cell segmentation, classification, and feature analysis in the KNIME analytical platform. For validation, we used a set of mouse mammary gland tumors and human lung adenocarcinoma tissue samples stained for multiple cellular markers and collagen as the main ECM protein. The developed package provides sufficient performance and precision to be used as a novel method to investigate cell-ECM relationships in the tissue, as well as detect structural patterns correlated with specific disease outcomes.",

Although the tGKF relies on Gaussianity, we show that a central limit theorem (CLT) for the parameter of interest is enough to obtain asymptotically precise covering even if the observations are non-Gaussian processes. As a proof of concept we study the functional signal-plus-noise model and derive a CLT for an estimator of the Lipshitz-Killing curvatures, the only data-dependent quantities in the tGKF. We further discuss extensions to discrete sampling with additive observation noise using scale space ideas from regression analysis. Our theoretical work is accompanied by a simulation study comparing different methods to construct SCBs for the population mean. We show that the tGKF outperforms state-of-the-art methods with precise covering for small sample sizes, and only a Rademacher multiplier-t bootstrap performs similarly well. A further benefit is that our SCBs are computational fast even for domains of dimension greater than one. Applications of SCBs to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fibers (1D) and spatio-temporal temperature data (2D) are discussed.",

		"abstract": "Experience replay is widely used in AI to bootstrap reinforcement learning (RL) by enabling an agent to remember and reuse past experiences. Classical techniques include shuffled-, reversed-ordered- and prioritized-memory buffers, which have different properties and advantages depending on the nature of the data and problem. Interestingly, recent computational neuroscience work has shown that these techniques are relevant to model hippocampal reactivations recorded during rodent navigation. Nevertheless, the brain mechanisms for orchestrating hippocampal replay are still unclear. In this paper, we present recent neurorobotics research aiming to endow a navigating robot with a neuro-inspired RL architecture (including different learning strategies, such as model-based (MB) and model-free (MF), and different replay techniques). We illustrate through a series of numerical simulations how the specificities of robotic experimentation (e.g., autonomous state decomposition by the robot, noisy perception, state transition uncertainty, non-stationarity) can shed new lights on which replay techniques turn out to be more efficient in different situations. Finally, we close the loop by raising new hypotheses for neuroscience from such robotic models of hippocampal replay.",

		"abstract": "Early diagnosis, prioritization, screening, clustering, and tracking of patients with COVID-19, and production of drugs and vaccines are some of the applications that have made it necessary to use a new style of technology to involve, manage, and deal with this epidemic. Strategies backed by artificial intelligence (A.I.) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been undeniably effective to understand how the virus works and prevent it from spreading. Accordingly, the main aim of this survey is to critically review the ML, IoT, and the integration of IoT and ML-based techniques in the applications related to COVID-19, from the diagnosis of the disease to the prediction of its outbreak. According to the main findings, IoT provided a prompt and efficient approach to tracking the disease spread. On the other hand, most of the studies developed by ML-based techniques aimed at the detection and handling of challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Among different approaches, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Support Vector Machine, Genetic CNN, and pre-trained CNN, followed by ResNet have demonstrated the best performances compared to other methods.",

		"abstract": "Numerous studies shown that particulate matter in the ambient environment has a significant impact on the health of the respiratory system. To understand the interrelationships between urban built environment, transportation operations and health, this study proposes an innovative approach that uses real-world GPS datasets to calculate energy consumption and emissions from transportation. The experiment used the traffic operation state in the Fourth Ring Road of Beijing as the research object and tested the impact of using the Regional speed optimization (RSO) strategy based on Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) on energy consumption and emissions during peak hours. The impact of traffic emission on the health of roadside pedestrians is also considered. Changes in PM2.5 concentrations around four different built-up areas were calculated and compared. The computational experiments indicate that the PM2.5 pollutants exhausted by the traffic on the Ring Road during peak hours can reach up to 250 \u03bcg/m 3, while the traffic emission on general roads near residential areas is only 50 \u03bcg/m 3. Adopting Regional speed optimization can reduce the energy consumption of the road network by up to 18.8%. For roadside runners, the PM2.5 inhalation caused by night running in commercial and recreational areas is about 1.3-2.6 times that of night running in residential areas. Compared with morning or night running, the risk of respiratory disease caused by PM2.5 inhalation was about 10.3% higher than commuter running behavior. The research results provide a useful reference for energy conservation and emission reduction control strategies for different road types in cities and help existing cities to establish a traveler health evaluation system caused by traffic operation.",

		"abstract": "Prostate cancer, recognized as a \"cold\" tumor, has an immunosuppressive microenvironment in which regulatory T cells (Tregs) usually play a major role. Therefore, identifying a prognostic signature of Tregs has promising benefits of improving survival of prostate cancer patients. However, the traditional methods of Treg quantification usually suffer from bias and variability. Transcriptional characteristics have recently been found to have a predictive power for the infiltration of Tregs. Thus, a novel machine learning-based computational framework has been presented using Tregs and 19 other immune cell types using 42 purified immune cell datasets from GEO to identify Treg-specific mRNAs, and a prognostic signature of Tregs (named \"TILTregSig\") consisting of five mRNAs (SOCS2, EGR1, RRM2, TPP1, and C11orf54) was developed and validated to monitor the prognosis of prostate cancer using the TCGA and ICGC datasets. The TILTregSig showed a stronger predictive power for tumor immunity compared with tumor mutation burden and glycolytic activity, which have been reported as immune predictors. Further analyses indicate that the TILTregSig might influence tumor immunity mainly by mediating tumor-infiltrating Tregs and could be a powerful predictor for Tregs in prostate cancer. Moreover, the TILTregSig showed a promising potential for predicting cancer immunotherapy (CIT) response in five CIT response datasets and therapeutic resistance in the GSCALite dataset in multiple cancers. Our TILTregSig derived from PBMCs makes it possible to achieve a straightforward, noninvasive, and inexpensive detection assay for prostate cancer compared with the current histopathological examination that requires invasive tissue puncture, which lays the foundation for the future development of a panel of different molecules in peripheral blood comprising a biomarker of prostate cancer.",

		"abstract": "Chronic intestinal inflammation underlies inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Previous studies indicated alterations in the cellular immune system; however, it has been challenging to interrogate the role of all immune cell subsets simultaneously. Therefore, we aimed to identify immune cell types associated with inflammation in IBD using high-dimensional mass cytometry. We analyzed 188 intestinal biopsies and paired blood samples of newly-diagnosed, treatment-naive patients (n=42) and controls (n=26) in two independent cohorts. We applied mass cytometry (36-antibody panel) to resolve single cells and analyzed the data with unbiased Hierarchical-SNE. In addition, imaging-mass cytometry (IMC) was performed to reveal the spatial distribution of the immune subsets in the tissue. We identified 44 distinct immune subsets. Correlation network analysis identified a network of inflammation-associated subsets, including HLA-DR+CD38+ EM CD4+ T cells, T regulatory-like cells, PD1+ EM CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, CD27+ TCR\u03b3\u03b4 cells and NK cells. All disease-associated subsets were validated in a second cohort. This network was abundant in a subset of patients, independent of IBD subtype, severity or intestinal location. Putative disease-associated CD4+ T cells were detectable in blood. Finally, imaging-mass cytometry revealed the spatial colocalization of neutrophils, memory CD4+ T cells and myeloid cells in the inflamed intestine. Our study indicates that a cellular network of both innate and adaptive immune cells colocalizes in inflamed biopsies from a subset of patients. These results contribute to dissecting disease heterogeneity and may guide the development of targeted therapeutics in IBD.",

		"abstract": "Real neural system usually contains two types of neurons, i.e., excitatory neurons and inhibitory ones. Analytical and numerical interpretation of dynamics induced by different types of interactions among the neurons of two types is beneficial to understanding those physiological functions of the brain. Here, we articulate a model of noise-perturbed random neural networks containing both excitatory and inhibitory (E&I) populations. Particularly, both intra-correlatively and inter-independently connected neurons in two populations are taken into account, which is different from the most existing E&I models only considering the independently-connected neurons. By employing the typical mean-field theory, we obtain an equivalent system of two dimensions with an input of stationary Gaussian process. Investigating the stationary autocorrelation functions along the obtained system, we analytically find the parameters' conditions under which the synchronized behaviors between the two populations are sufficiently emergent. Taking the maximal Lyapunov exponent as an index, we also find different critical values of the coupling strength coefficients for the chaotic excitatory neurons and for the chaotic inhibitory ones. Interestingly, we reveal that the noise is able to suppress chaotic dynamics of the random neural networks having neurons in two populations, while an appropriate amount of correlation coefficient in intra-coupling strengths can enhance chaos occurrence. Finally, we also detect a previously-reported phenomenon where the parameters region corresponds to neither linearly stable nor chaotic dynamics; however, the size of the region area crucially depends on the populations' parameters.",

However, a limitation of these techniques is their black-box nature, which prevents the ability for increased mechanistic phenomenological understanding. In this article, we develop an inferential framework for estimating causal effects with radiomics data. A new challenge is that the exposure of interest is latent so that new estimation procedures are needed. We leverage a multivariate version of partial least squares for causal effect estimation. The methodology is illustrated with applications to two radiomics datasets, one in osteosarcoma and one in glioblastoma.",

Data science and computational methods can be leveraged to better identify relationships between exposures to stressors in the environment and human disease outcomes, representing critical information needed to protect and improve global public health. Still, there remains a critical gap surrounding the training of researchers on these in silico methods. We aimed to address this gap by developing the inTelligence And Machine lEarning (TAME) Toolkit, promoting trainee-driven data generation, management, and analysis methods to \"TAME\" data in environmental health studies. Training modules were developed to provide applications-driven examples of data organization and analysis methods that can be used to address environmental health questions. Target audiences for these modules include students, post-baccalaureate and post-doctorate trainees, and professionals that are interested in expanding their skillset to include recent advances in data analysis methods relevant to environmental health, toxicology, exposure science, epidemiology, and bioinformatics/cheminformatics. Modules were developed by study coauthors using annotated script and were organized into three chapters within a GitHub Bookdown site. The first chapter of modules focuses on introductory data science, which includes the following topics: setting up R/RStudio and coding in the R environment; data organization basics; finding and visualizing data trends; high-dimensional data visualizations; and Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) data management practices. The second chapter of modules incorporates chemical-biological analyses and predictive modeling, spanning the following methods: dose-response modeling; machine learning and predictive modeling; mixtures analyses; -omics analyses; toxicokinetic modeling; and read-across toxicity predictions. The last chapter of modules was organized to provide examples on environmental health database mining and integration, including chemical exposure, health outcome, and environmental justice indicators. Training modules and associated data are publicly available online (https://uncsrp.github.io/Data-Analysis-Training-Modules/). Together, this resource provides unique opportunities to obtain introductory-level training on current data analysis methods applicable to 21st century science and environmental health.",

		"abstract": "The degree of \u03c0 orbital overlap (DPO) model has been demonstrated to be an excellent quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) that can map two-dimensional structural information of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and thienoacenes to their electronic properties, namely, band gaps, electron affinities, and ionization potentials. However, the model suffers from significant limitations that narrow its applications due to inefficient manual procedures in parameter optimization and descriptor formulation. In this work, we developed a machine learning (ML)-based method for efficiently optimizing DPO parameters and proposed a truncated DPO descriptor, which is simple enough that can be automatically extracted from simplified molecular-input line-entry system strings of PAHs and thienoacenes. Compared with the result from our previous studies, the ML-based methodology can optimize DPO parameters with four times fewer data, while it can achieve the same level of accuracy in predictions of the mentioned electronic properties to within 0.1 eV. The truncated DPO model also has similar accuracy to the full DPO model. Consequently, the ML-based DPO approach coupled with the truncated DPO model enables new possibilities for developing automatic pipelines for high-throughput screening and investigating new QSPR for new chemical classes.",

		"abstract": "Background\nA clinical study comparing the hemodynamic outcomes of transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) with vs. without Laceration of the Anterior Mitral leaflet to Prevent Outflow Obstruction (LAMPOON) has never been designed nor conducted.\n\n\nAims\nTo quantify the hemodynamic impact of LAMPOON in TMVR using patient-specific computational (in silico) models.\n\n\nMaterials\nEight subjects from the LAMPOON investigational device exemption trial were included who had acceptable computed tomography (CT) data for analysis. All subjects were anticipated to be at prohibitive risk of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction from TMVR, and underwent successful LAMPOON immediately followed by TMVR. Using post-procedure CT scans, two 3D anatomical models were created for each subject: (1) TMVR with LAMPOON (performed procedure), and (2) TMVR without LAMPOON (virtual control). A validated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) paradigm was then used to simulate the hemodynamic outcomes for each condition.\n\n\nResults\nLAMPOON exposed on average 2 \u00b1 0.6 transcatheter valve cells (70 \u00b1 20 mm2 total increase in outflow area) which provided an additional pathway for flow into the LVOT. As compared to TMVR without LAMPOON, TMVR with LAMPOON resulted in lower peak LVOT velocity, lower peak LVOT gradient, and higher peak LVOT effective orifice area by 0.4 \u00b1 0.3 m/s (14 \u00b1 7% improvement, p = 0.006), 7.6 \u00b1 10.9 mmHg (31 \u00b1 17% improvement, p = 0.01), and 0.2 \u00b1 0.1 cm2 (17 \u00b1 9% improvement, p = 0.002), respectively.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis was the first study to permit a quantitative, patient-specific comparison of LVOT hemodynamics following TMVR with and without LAMPOON. The LAMPOON procedure achieved a critical increment in outflow area which was effective for improving LVOT hemodynamics, particularly for subjects with a small neo-left ventricular outflow tract (neo-LVOT).",

		"abstract": "With continued advancement in computational technologies, the analysis of EEG has shifted from pure visual analysis to a non-invasive computational technique called EEG source imaging (ESI), which involves mathematical modeling of dipolar and distributed sources of a given scalp EEG pattern. ESI is a noninvasive phase I test for presurgical localization of the seizure onset zone in focal epilepsy. It is a relatively inexpensive modality as it leverages scalp EEG and MRI data already collected typically during presurgical evaluation. With an adequate number of electrodes and combined with patient-specific MRI-based head models, ESI has proven to be a valuable and accurate clinical diagnostic tool for localizing the epileptogenic zone. Despite its advantages however, ESI is routinely used only at a minority of epilepsy centers. This paper reviews the current evidence and practical fundamentals for using EEG source imaging of interictal and ictal epileptic activity during the pre-surgical evaluation of drug-resistant patients. We identify common errors in processing and interpreting ESI studies, and describe the differences in approach needed for localizing interictal and ictal EEG discharges through practical examples, and we describe best practices for optimizing the diagnostic information available from these studies.",

		"abstract": "Claudins (Cldns) form a large family of protein homologs that are essential for the assembly of paracellular tight junctions (TJs), where they form channels or barriers with tissue-specific selectivity for permeants. In contrast to several family members whose physiological role has been identified, the function of claudin 4 (Cldn4) remains elusive, despite experimental evidence suggesting that it can form anion-selective TJ channels in the renal epithelium. Computational approaches have recently been employed to elucidate the molecular basis of Cldns' function, and hence could help in clarifying the role of Cldn4. In this work, we use structural modeling and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to transfer two previously introduced structural models of Cldn-based paracellular complexes to Cldn4 to reproduce a paracellular anion channel. Free energy calculations for ionic transport through the pores allow us to establish the thermodynamic properties driving the ion-selectivity of the structures. While one model shows a cavity permeable to chloride and repulsive to cations, the other forms barrier to the passage of all the major physiological ions. Furthermore, our results confirm the charge selectivity role of the residue Lys65 in the first extracellular loop of the protein, rationalizing Cldn4 control of paracellular permeability.",

		"abstract": "In recent years, different natural language processing tools measured aspects related to narratives' structural, semantic, and emotional content. However, there is a need to better understand the limitations and effectiveness of speech elicitation protocols. The graph-theoretical analysis applied to short narratives reveals lower connectedness associated with negative symptoms even in the early stages of psychosis, but emotional topics seem more informative than others. We investigate the interaction between connectedness and emotional words with negative symptoms and educational level in participants with and without psychosis. For that purpose, we used a speech elicitation protocol based on three positive affective pictures and calculated the proportion of emotional words and connectedness measures in the first-episode psychosis (FEP) group (N: 24) and a control group (N: 33). First, we replicated the association between connectedness and negative symptoms (R2: 0.53, p: 0.0049). Second, the more positive terms, the more connected the narrative was, exclusively under psychosis and in association with education, pointing to an interaction between symptoms and formal education. Negative symptoms were independently associated with connectedness, but not with emotional words, although the associations with education were mutually dependent. Together, education and symptoms explained almost 70\u00a0% of connectedness variance (R2: 0.67, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), but not emotional expression. At this initial stage of psychosis, education seems to play an important role, diminishing the impact of negative symptoms on the narrative connectedness. Negative symptoms in FEP impact narrative connectedness in association with emotional expression, revealing aspects of social cognition through a short and innocuous protocol.",

		"abstract": "Human KIBRA, a member of the WWC family proteins, is an upstream regulator of the Salvador/Warts/Hippo (SWH) signaling pathway and predominately expressed in nervous system. The protein has two functionally regulatory domains WW1 and WW2 at N-terminal region, which recognize and bind to the PY-motif segments of their partner proteins to serve as a signaling scaffold role in the SWH pathway. The two domains are highly conserved, but their downstream ligands and biological functions may not be fully consistent. In this study, we attempted to systematically profile the PY-motif affinity to and selectivity between KIBRA WW1 and WW2 domains involved in partner recognition sites. Ontology mining was used to enrich the KIBRA-interacting proteins in literature libraries, from which a variety of PY-motif peptide segments were identified, and their binding behavior to each domain was then analyzed by integrating computational modeling and experimental assay. Most PY-motif peptides were found to interact potently with WW1 and WW2, but they generally only exhibit a moderate or modest selectivity between the two domains. Subsequently, several representative peptides were further examined in detail to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying their affinity and selectivity. It is revealed that the middle motif region of PY-motif peptides is primarily responsible for the affinity and stability of peptide binding, but only contributes marginally to peptide selectivity. Instead, the N-terminal region and, particularly, C-terminal region of PY-motif peptides play a crucial role in the selectivity. Hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonds confer stability and specificity to the domain-peptide interaction, respectively.",

		"abstract": "Silent gesture studies, in which hearing participants from different linguistic backgrounds produce gestures to communicate events, have been used to test hypotheses about the cognitive biases that govern cross-linguistic word order preferences. In particular, the differential use of SOV and SVO order to communicate, respectively, extensional events (where the direct object exists independently of the event; e.g., girl throws ball) and intensional events (where the meaning of the direct object is potentially dependent on the verb; e.g., girl thinks of ball), has been suggested to represent a natural preference, demonstrated in improvisation contexts. However, natural languages tend to prefer systematic word orders, where a single order is used regardless of the event being communicated. We present a series of studies that investigate ordering preferences for SOV and SVO orders using an online forced-choice experiment, where English-speaking participants select orders for different events i) in the absence of conventions and ii) after learning event-order mappings in different frequencies in a regularisation experiment. Our results show that natural ordering preferences arise in the absence of conventions, replicating previous findings from production experiments. In addition, we show that participants regularise the input they learn in the manual modality in two ways, such that, while the preference for systematic order patterns increases through learning, it exists in competition with the natural ordering preference, that conditions order on the semantics of the event. Using our experimental data in a computational model of cultural transmission, we show that this pattern is expected to persist over generations, suggesting that we should expect to see evidence of semantically-conditioned word order variability in at least some languages.",

		"abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship of 18 radiomorphometric parameters of panoramic radiographs based on age, and to estimate the age group of people with permanent dentition in a non-invasive, comprehensive, and accurate manner using five machine learning algorithms. For the study population (209 men and 262 women; mean age, 32.12\u2009\u00b1\u200918.71\u00a0years), 471 digital panoramic radiographs of Korean individuals were applied. The participants were divided into three groups (with a 20-year age gap) and six groups (with a 10-year age gap), and each age group was estimated using the following five machine learning models: a linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, kernelized support vector machines, multilayer perceptron, and extreme gradient boosting. Finally, a Fisher discriminant analysis was used to visualize the data configuration. In the prediction of the three age-group classification, the areas under the curve (AUCs) obtained for classifying young ages (10-19\u00a0years) ranged from 0.85 to 0.88 for five different machine learning models. The AUC values of the older age group (50-69\u00a0years) ranged from 0.82 to 0.88, and those of adults (20-49\u00a0years) were approximately 0.73. In the six age-group classification, the best scores were also found in age groups 1 (10-19\u00a0years) and 6 (60-69\u00a0years), with mean AUCs ranging from 0.85 to 0.87 and 80 to 0.90, respectively. A feature analysis based on LDA weights showed that the L-Pulp Area was important for discriminating young ages (10-49\u00a0years), and L-Crown, U-Crown, L-Implant, U-Implant, and Periodontitis were used as predictors for discriminating older ages (50-69\u00a0years). We established acceptable linear and nonlinear machine learning models for a dental age group estimation using multiple maxillary and mandibular radiomorphometric parameters. Since certain radiomorphological characteristics of young and the elderly were linearly related to age, young and old groups could be easily distinguished from other age groups with automated machine learning models.",

Based on the data collected, this study developed novel machine learning methods to predict carbon dioxide production from green waste composting and made a comparison among six methods. After eliminating the extreme outliers from the dataset, the Random Forest algorithm achieved the highest prediction accuracy of 88% in the classification task and showed the top performance in the regression task (root mean square error = 23.3). As the most critical factor, total organic carbon, with the Gini index accounting for about 59%, can provide guidance for reducing carbon emissions from green waste composting.

		"abstract": "Microglia is a major class of brain-resident myeloid cells and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) serves as key regulators in microglia homeostasis and inflammatory process. Here, we constructed the systematical association between microglia and ncRNAs including miRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNAs from two aspects, manual retrieval and computational detection. A total of 648 experimental verified ncRNA-microglia associations were obtained from published studies, including ncRNA regulatory patterns within different experimental models. Furthermore, we extracted 9 miRNA and 1 lncRNA expression profiles from the GEO database. Also, we obtained 31 sample-match miRNA and mRNA expression profiles, containing a total of 2335 normal or disordered brain samples. Finally, we developed a platform named MG-ncRexplorer (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/MG-ncRexplorer/), exploring the associations between ncRNAs and microglia among experimental validated and computational detection. To demonstrate the usage of MG-ncRexplorer, we constructed regulatory target networks based on manual retrieval associations and identified risk glioma miRNAs among multiple high-throughput expression profiles.",

		"abstract": "Knowledge of RNA solvent accessibility has recently become attractive due to the increasing awareness of its importance for key biological process. Accurately predicting the solvent accessibility of RNA is crucial for understanding its 3D structure and biological function. In this study, we develop a novel computational method, termed M2pred, for accurately predicting the solvent accessibility of RNA from sequence-based multi-scale context feature. In M2pred, three single-view features, i.e., base-pairing probabilities, position-specific frequency matrix, and a binary one-hot encoding, are first generated as three feature sources, and immediately concatenated to engender a super feature. Secondly, for the super feature, the matrix-format features of each nucleotide are extracted using an initialized sliding window technique, and regularly stacked into a cube-format feature. Then, using multi-scale context feature extraction strategy, a pyramid feature constructed of contextual feature of four scales related to target nucleotides is extracted from the cube-format feature. Finally, a customized multi-shot neural network framework, which is equipped with four different scales of receptive fields mainly integrating several residual attention blocks, is designed to dig discrimination information from the contextual pyramid feature. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed M2pred achieve a high prediction performance and outperforms existing state-of-the-art prediction methods of RNA solvent accessibility.",

		"abstract": "The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) system serves to translocate folded proteins across energy-transducing membranes in bacteria, archaea, plastids and some mitochondria. In Escherichia coli, TatA, TatB, and TatC constitute functional translocons. TatA and TatB both possess an N-terminal transmembrane helix (TMH) followed by an amphipathic helix (APH). The TMHs of TatA and TatB generate a hydrophobic mismatch with the membrane, as the helices comprise only 12 consecutive hydrophobic residues; however, the purpose of this mismatch is unclear. Here, we shortened or extended this stretch of hydrophobic residues in either TatA, TatB, or both, and analyzed effects on translocon function and assembly. We found the wild-type length helices functioned best, but some variation was clearly tolerated. Defects in function were exacerbated by simultaneous mutations in TatA and TatB, indicating partial compensation of mutations in each by the other. Furthermore, length variation in TatB destabilized TatBC-containing complexes, revealing that the 12-residue-length is important but not essential for this interaction and translocon assembly. To also address potential effects of helix length on TatA interactions, we characterized these interactions by molecular dynamics simulations, after having characterized the TatA assemblies by metal-tagging transmission electron microscopy. In these simulations, we found interacting short TMHs of larger TatA assemblies were thinning the membrane, and together with laterally-aligned tilted APHs, generated a deep V-shaped membrane groove. We propose the 12 consecutive hydrophobic residues may thus serve to destabilize the membrane during Tat transport, and their conservation could represent a delicate compromise between functionality and minimization of proton leakage.",
