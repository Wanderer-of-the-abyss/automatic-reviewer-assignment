[{'abstract': 'Metabolism is the process by which an organism continuously '
              'replaces old substances with new substances. It plays an '
              'important role in maintaining human life, body growth and '
              'reproduction. More and more researchers have shown that the '
              'concentrations of some metabolites in patients are different '
              'from those in healthy people. Traditional biological '
              'experiments can test some hypotheses and verify their '
              'relationships but usually take a considerable amount of time '
              'and money. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a new '
              'computational method to identify the relationships between '
              'metabolites and diseases. In this work, we present a new deep '
              'learning algorithm named as graph convolutional network with '
              'graph attention network (GCNAT) to predict the potential '
              'associations of disease-related metabolites. First, we '
              'construct a heterogeneous network based on known '
              'metabolite-disease associations, metabolite-metabolite '
              'similarities and disease-disease similarities. Metabolite and '
              'disease features are encoded and learned through the graph '
              'convolutional neural network. Then, a graph attention layer is '
              'used to combine the embeddings of multiple convolutional '
              'layers, and the corresponding attention coefficients are '
              'calculated to assign different weights to the embeddings of '
              'each layer. Further, the prediction result is obtained by '
              'decoding and scoring the final synthetic embeddings. Finally, '
              'GCNAT achieves a reliable area under the receiver operating '
              'characteristic curve of 0.95 and the precision-recall curve of '
              '0.405, which are better than the results of existing five '
              'state-of-the-art predictive methods in 5-fold cross-validation, '
              'and the case studies show that the metabolite-disease '
              'correlations predicted by our method can be successfully '
              'demonstrated by relevant experiments. We hope that GCNAT could '
              'be a useful biomedical research tool for predicting potential '
              'metabolite-disease associations in the future.',
